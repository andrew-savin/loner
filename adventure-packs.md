# Adventure Packs

Adventure Packs are very light-weight settings in which some elements are provided to kick start your game in some predefined genres.
Inside you will find a concise setting, traits for characters, special setting rules, NPCs, enemies, factions, locations and adventure seeds.
Use them as non-binding guidelines and inspiration, let your imagination run wild!
