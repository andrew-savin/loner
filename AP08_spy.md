## Genre Rules

- **Cover identities**: The player must maintain their cover identity while on missions, and risk exposure if they act out of character. To maintain their cover, players must describe their actions in a way that is consistent with their character's identity, and the Oracle will determine whether or not they succeed. If a player acts out of character, the Oracle may rule that their cover is compromised, and they will face consequences.
- **Interrogation**: The player may be captured and interrogated, and must resist giving up important information. When a player is captured and interrogated, they must resist giving up important information by answering questions in a way that is vague or misleading. The Oracle will determine whether or not they are successful in resisting interrogation based on their answer.
- **Political tensions**: The political climate is always shifting, and the player may find themselves caught up in the middle of a larger conflict. The player must navigate these political tensions carefully, as their actions may have consequences that extend beyond their immediate mission. When the player takes actions that affect the larger political situation, the Oracle will determine the consequences of their actions based on the range of possible answers.
