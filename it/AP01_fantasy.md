## Special Rule: Magic
A character may use their Luck to cast spells. Each spell or magic ability has a Luck cost associated with it. The cost can be different depending on the spell or ability. When a protagonist wants to use a spell or magic ability, they must spend Luck from their pool. Then rolls the dice to determine the outcome of the action:
- **No and**: the spell fails and the character suffers some other negative effect.
- **No**: the spell fails and the character loses the mana spent.
- **No but**: the spell fails but the character doesn't lose the mana spent.
- **Yes but**: the spell succeeds but with some negative effect or drawback.
- **Yes**: the spell succeeds.
- **Yes and**: the spell succeeds and the character gains additional benefits or advantages.

Luck consumed for casting spells recharges after a rest in a safe area. If a Conflict takes place, Luck points will be based on the current value and reset when the Conflict is over according to the basic rules.
