# Loner
Another Solo RPG Game
CC BY 4.0 by Roberto Bisceglie

Loner is a bare-bone freeform solo RPG designed to play with a solo character in "narrative" mode. You'll guide your character through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an oracle who will assume the role of Game Master. Every now and then the game will surprise you when an unexpected plot twist happens!

To play it, it is assumed that you are already familiar with the world of role-playing and solo games. Good places to get an idea are the [RPG page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) on Wikipedia and the [Lone Wolf Roleplaying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/wiki/guides) subreddit.

## Minimum Requirements
You will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **notebook**: Loner is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Make a Character

Your protagonist (or hero if you wish) is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: the name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: the long-term objective.
- **Motive**: what drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: a person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: 6

**Example**
> **Zahra Nakajima** Witty Street Cat. Streetwise, Nimble, Merciful. 
>  Knife, Low O2 Supplement.
> She wants to obtain unknown technology to save her planet from atmosphere collapse.
> **Nemesis**: The Naturalist Order
> **Luck**: 6

Everything else in the game is a "character". The are living (the Non-Playing Characters) and inanimate characters (as vehicles and crafts). Inanimate characters does not have goal, movite or nemesis.

**Example**
> **The Century Skylark** Spacecraft in bad shape. Hyperjump Drive, Camouflage Circuits, Midlife Courier. 
> Shields, Turrets. 
> **Luck**: 6.

## Start your game
Decide on an initial scene for your adventure. Starting the game in the middle of an action scene is a good way to set events in motion. If nothing If none comes to mind, roll on each of the following questions to generate a random adventure seed.

| D6 |  Who?<br>The proposer   | What?<br>The mission | Why?<br>The incentive | Where?<br>The target |        How?<br>The seed       | Obstacle?<br>The complication |
|:--:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|  1 |        Authority        |        Rescue        |          Help         |        Person        |        Casual encounter       |           Opposition          |
|  2 |       Organization      |      Protection      |        Fortune        |         Group        |        Old acquaintance       |           Deception           |
|  3 | Ally (friend, relative) |        Exploit       |       Coercition      |       Treasure       |             Rumors            |          Environment          |
|  4 |          Mentor         |        Explore       |        Impulse        |       Location       |            Capture            |            Disguise           |
|  5 |       Help-seeker       |        Escape        |        Ambition       |       McGuffin       |             Mishap            |              Time             |
|  6 |       Blackmailer       |        Pursuit       |        Revenge        |      Confession      | Object (map, journal, letter) |             Space             |

## Keep the action in motion

A game in Loner is a succession of scenes. A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. In a traditional role-playing game, it is the Game Master who proposes the scene and moves the world and NPCs. In a solo role-playing game, on the other hand, the player asks questions to an Oracle (as he would to a GM) who will provide a closed answer. It is therefore necessary to formulate questions whose answer is binary (Yes, No).

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**. If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.

Also look at the value on each die. If both are low (3 or less), add **But**. If both are high (4 or more), add **And**.

**Example**
> You ask, “Does the vampire catch fire?” You roll one Chance Die and one Risk Die and get 5 4. The answer is **Yes**, because the Chance Die is higher. You add also **And**, because both rolls are 4 or higher. If the Risk Die had come up as 3, it would have been a plain **Yes** instead.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive traits grant an advantage, add a **chance die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative traits cause a disadvantage, add a **risk die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

## Harm & Luck

When you are in conflict the game is played in turns alternating between player and NPCs. When you fail your defense, reduce your current Luck according to the table below. NPCs also have a Luck trait. If you attack in any form, reduce the targets Luck according to the table below. When your Luck runs out you face mortal danger and the next attack will take you out of the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer | Do you get what you want? | Harm |
|---|---| --- |
|Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.| Cause 3 |
|Yes... | You get what you want.| Cause 2 |
|Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.| Cause 1 |
|No, but... | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss.| Take 1 |
|No... | You don’t get what you were after.| Take 2 |
|No, and... | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.| Take 3| 

## Doubles and the Crisis Counter
The Crisis Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

## Determine the Twist

Roll 2d6 and consult the following lists to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

## Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene, you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** that takes place somewhere else than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

## Sibylline Responses
The Oracle might sometimes give answers that don't make sense in the context of the scene. Don't be tempted to detail the answer with too many questions in sequence. Three questions should be sufficient. If you're still stuck, try using an open-ended question to unlock yourself or interpret the answer as "Yes, But..." and move the story forward. 

## Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the following tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

| Verbs |     1    |    2   |    3    |     4    |    5    |    6    |
|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   1   |  inject  |  pass  |   own   |  divide  |   bury  |  borrow |
|   2   | continue |  learn |   ask   | multiply | receive | imagine |
|   3   |  develop | behave | replace |  damage  | collect |   turn  |
|   4   |   share  |  hand  |   play  |  explain | improve |  cough  |

|   6   |   trip   |  want  |   miss  |    dry   |  employ | destroy |

|      4     |    silky    |   worthless   |   fixed   |     loose     |   willing   |    cold   |
|      5     |    quiet    |     stormy    |   spooky  |   delirious   |    innate   |    late   |
|      6     | magnificent |    arrogant   | unhealthy |    enormous   |  truculent  |  charming |
