***Loner*** is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations. 
Adventure Packs are very lightweight settings in which some elements are provided to kick start your game in some predefined genres.
Inside you will find a concise setting, traits for characters, special setting rules, NPCs, enemies, factions, locations and adventure seeds.
- Setting information: Each genre pack would include information about the setting of the game, including the time period, location, and any important cultural or historical details.
- Character options: Different genres may have different types of characters, so you could include additional character options for players to choose from.
   - Concepts (adjective+noun format)
   - Skills
   - Frailties
   - Gear
- Special rules: Each genre may have its own set of special rules that players need to follow. For example, a fantasy genre pack may include rules for magic and spellcasting, while a horror genre pack might include rules for fear and insanity.
- Additional information:
  - Factions
  - NPCs
  - Creatures/Monsters/Foes
  - Locations
- Adventure seeds: To help players come up with ideas for their adventures, you could include a list of possible adventure seeds for each genre pack. These could be specific to the genre, such as a fantasy adventure seed involving a quest to retrieve a powerful artifact, or a science fiction adventure seed involving a mission to explore a new planet.
