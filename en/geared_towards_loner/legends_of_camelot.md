# Legends of Camelot

***Legends of Camelot*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the mythic realm of King Arthur's Camelot, blending medieval Britain with enchanting fantasy elements.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to immerse you in the legendary world of Arthurian tales, where magic, chivalry, and epic quests await.

## Introduction

*Legends of Camelot* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Legends of Camelot** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Brave Knight," "Wise Sage," or "Cunning Thief."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Legends of Camelot* you will need:
- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Legends of Camelot* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

The setting of ***Legends of Camelot*** is steeped in the rich lore of King Arthur and Camelot, blending historical elements from the 6th century AD with fantastical features that bring the world to life.

- **Theme**: The central theme revolves around the legendary King Arthur and his fabled court of Camelot. This is a world where chivalry and honor are the highest virtues, and where the ideals of knighthood are embodied by Arthur and his noble knights. The tales of bravery, loyalty, and the pursuit of justice are interwoven with magic and mystery.

- **Time Period**: The game is set in the 6th century AD, a time of great upheaval and transformation in Britain. This period, often referred to as the Dark Ages, is characterized by the struggle between the native Britons and the invading Saxons. It's a time of war and heroism, where legends are born and history is written by the brave and the bold.

- **Location**: The primary setting is medieval England, specifically the kingdom of Camelot, which serves as a beacon of hope and civilization in a time of chaos. The rugged landscapes, dense forests, and ancient castles create a backdrop of both beauty and danger. Beyond Camelot, the land is dotted with small villages, mystical ruins, and uncharted wilderness.

- **Fantasy Elements**: The world of Camelot is imbued with magic and mythical beings. Dragons soar through the skies, fairies and elves dwell in enchanted forests, and powerful sorcerers wield ancient spells. Magical objects like Excalibur, the legendary sword of King Arthur, and the Holy Grail, the ultimate symbol of divine grace, are central to the lore and quests.

- **Central Hub**: The court of Camelot, with its grand castle and the iconic Round Table, is the heart of the setting. It is here that King Arthur rules, dispensing justice and wisdom, and where the Knights of the Round Table gather to plan their quests and adventures. The castle is a place of both opulence and strategic importance, filled with intrigue, loyalty, and occasional treachery.

- **Main Characters**: The setting is populated by iconic figures from Arthurian legend. King Arthur, the wise and just ruler, embodies the ideals of kingship but is not without his human flaws. Merlin, the enigmatic wizard, serves as his advisor and protector. Morgana, a powerful sorceress, walks the fine line between friend and foe. Lancelot, the greatest of the knights, struggles with his forbidden love for Queen Guinevere, while other knights like Gawain, Percival, and Galahad each bring their unique strengths and stories to the Round Table.

- **Druidic Influence**: The ancient druidic traditions are a vital part of the setting. Sacred woods, where ancient rituals are performed and old Celtic beliefs are honored, offer a mystical and spiritual dimension to the world. Druids, with their deep connection to nature and the supernatural, often play crucial roles in the unfolding events.

- **Enemies**: The peace and prosperity of Camelot are constantly threatened by external and internal enemies. The invading Saxons seek to conquer and dominate the land, bringing war to the very gates of Camelot. Within the court, Mordred, Arthur's treacherous son, conspires to usurp the throne and plunge the kingdom into darkness.

- **Epic Quests**: Central to the game's narrative are the epic quests undertaken by the characters. The quest for the Holy Grail, the defense of Camelot against invaders, and the search for lost relics are just a few of the adventures that drive the story forward. These quests are fraught with peril and promise, testing the characters' courage, wisdom, and resolve.

- **Court Intrigues**: Life at the court of Camelot is rife with political maneuvering, secret alliances, and personal vendettas. Betrayals and internal conflicts among the knights create a dynamic and ever-changing landscape of loyalty and deceit. The players must navigate this web of intrigue to achieve their goals and maintain the stability of the kingdom.

- **Romantic and Tragic Elements**: The legends of Camelot are rich with tales of love and tragedy. The forbidden love between Lancelot and Queen Guinevere, the doomed romance of Tristan and Isolde, and other such stories add a layer of emotional depth and complexity to the setting. These elements highlight the human side of the epic tales, where passion, honor, and duty often come into conflict.

## Characters

In *Legends of Camelot*, characters, whether they are protagonists, NPCs, monsters, or even significant objects, are described using tags.

### Everything is a Character!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Knight"* or *"Clever Druid"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Beast Tamer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Legends of Camelot* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Legends of Camelot* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Legends of Camelot* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.

| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Magic

Magic is a fundamental aspect of the world of Camelot, influencing events and characters alike. Characters with magical abilities can cast spells, perform enchantments, and interact with mystical forces. However, magic is unpredictable and can have unintended consequences.

- **Casting Spells**: When a character attempts to cast a spell (you can use the Spell table for inspiration or make your own), they must test their expectations using the Oracle system. Roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**. If circumstances grant an advantage (e.g., using a powerful artifact, favorable conditions), add a **Chance Die**. If there is a disadvantage (e.g., lack of preparation, distractions), add a **Risk Die**.
  - **Yes**: The spell is successful.
  - **No**: The spell fails.
  - **Yes, but...**: The spell is successful, but there is a minor negative consequence.
  - **Yes, and...**: The spell is successful, and there is an additional positive effect.
  - **No, but...**: The spell fails, but there is a minor positive outcome or no harm done.
  - **No, and...**: The spell fails, and there is an additional negative consequence.

- **Magical Consequences**: Spells, whether successful or not, may have lingering effects. For example, a spell might drain the caster's energy, attract unwanted attention, or alter the environment. These effects should be interpreted based on the context and the nature of the spell.

| D66 | Spell                                               |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | **Light of Avalon:** Create a bright light that illuminates dark areas.  |

### Chivalric Code

Knights and heroes in Camelot are bound by a strict code of honor, which governs their actions and decisions. Upholding this code is essential for maintaining one's reputation and status within the court.

- **Honor Test**: When a character faces a situation that challenges their adherence to the chivalric code, they must test their expectations using the Oracle system. Advantage or disadvantage can be added based on the character's reputation, prior actions, and the specific situation.
  - **Yes**: The character upholds the code successfully.
  - **No**: The character fails to uphold the code.
  - **Yes, but...**: The character upholds the code, but at a personal cost or with a complication.
  - **Yes, and...**: The character upholds the code and gains additional honor or recognition.
  - **No, but...**: The character fails to uphold the code, but mitigates some of the negative consequences.
  - **No, and...**: The character fails to uphold the code, and there are additional repercussions.
- **Reputation**: Actions against the chivalric code result in a loss of reputation, leading to disadvantages in social interactions, loss of support from allies, or even expulsion from the Round Table. Conversely, consistently upholding the code enhances the character's reputation, leading to increased influence and respect.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the [Inspiration tables](#inspiration-tables) (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Exploring the World

*Legends of Camelot* encourages exploration and adventure. Your character will traverse medieval Britain, encountering mystical creatures, ancient ruins, and legendary artifacts.

### Preparation

* **Choose Your Mode of Travel:** Consider your character's skills, resources, and the desired speed of travel.
* **Stock Up:**  Gather supplies based on your chosen travel time and potential hazards. 

### The Journey

#### Land Exploration

* **Navigation Check:** Roll a d6 to navigate. On a 4+, navigate successfully. On a 3 or less, consult the "Land Encounters" table for a random encounter or complication.
* **Weather Check:** Every d6 hours roll a d6. On a 1 or 2, encounter rough weather (rain, storms) that may cause delays or difficulties.
* **Scouting Check (optional):** Attempt to scout the area. Before entering an unexplored area, roll a d6. On a 4+, gain a brief glimpse of the surrounding terrain and potential dangers. On a 3 or less, you miss crucial details.

## Setting Information

### The Historical Context

#### Post-Roman Britain

After the withdrawal of the Roman Empire in the early 5th century, Britain found itself in a state of fragmentation and turmoil. The once-unified province, protected and governed by Roman authority, splintered into numerous smaller kingdoms and tribes, each vying for control and dominance. This period, often referred to as the Dark Ages, was marked by a lack of centralized power, frequent conflicts, and a struggle for survival among the various factions.

- **Fragmentation and Kingdoms**: Without the unifying force of Rome, Britain became a patchwork of petty kingdoms and tribal territories. Local warlords and chieftains, many of whom claimed noble or royal lineage, sought to establish their own domains. Prominent among these were the kingdoms of Dumnonia, Powys, Gwynedd, and others, each with its own culture, traditions, and ambitions.
- **Power Struggles**: These smaller kingdoms frequently engaged in warfare against each other, forming and breaking alliances as they sought to expand their territories and secure their borders. The lack of a central authority led to a volatile political landscape, where loyalty was often fluid and short-lived.

#### Saxon Invasions

Amidst the internal strife, Britain faced an external threat from the Saxons, a confederation of Germanic tribes seeking new lands to settle. The Saxons launched repeated invasions, aiming to conquer and colonize Britain, further destabilizing the region.

- **Initial Raids**: The Saxons began their incursions with coastal raids, targeting vulnerable villages and towns. These raids gradually escalated into larger, more organized invasions, with Saxon warbands penetrating deeper into the British heartland.
- **Major Battles**: Significant battles such as the Battle of Badon Hill, where Arthur is said to have led the Britons to victory, became crucial in the defense against the Saxons. Despite occasional victories, the threat remained persistent, with the Saxons establishing footholds in various parts of the island.
- **Cultural Impact**: The Saxon presence introduced new cultural elements, influencing local customs, language, and warfare. However, it also reinforced the Britons' sense of identity and resistance, galvanizing efforts to preserve their way of life.

#### Celtic Influence

Despite the chaos, the remnants of Celtic culture continued to thrive, influencing the emerging Arthurian ideals and providing a rich tapestry of traditions, beliefs, and practices.

- **Language and Art**: The Celtic language, art, and craftsmanship remained integral to British society. Intricate knotwork designs, metalwork, and oral storytelling traditions preserved the legacy of the Celts. Bards and poets played a crucial role in maintaining cultural continuity through their songs and tales.
- **Religion and Beliefs**: While Christianity was spreading, many Britons still adhered to Celtic paganism. Sacred groves, stone circles, and druidic rituals were part of everyday life. Druids, as spiritual leaders, conducted ceremonies and provided guidance, ensuring that the ancient beliefs were not entirely eclipsed by the new religion.
- **Integration with Arthurian Ideals**: The Arthurian legend itself is deeply rooted in Celtic mythology. Arthur's connection to mystical elements, such as his supposed resting place in Avalon and his association with magical figures like Merlin, reflects the enduring influence of Celtic lore. The blending of Christian and pagan elements in the legends mirrors the cultural syncretism of the time.
