I want to compile the following text by developing a setting that has these features:
- The main theme is King Arthur and Camelot
- Medieval setting in England/Britain during the 6th century AD.
- Presence of fantasy elements such as magic, mythological creatures (dragons, fairies, etc.) and magical objects (Excalibur, Holy Grail, etc.)
- The court of Camelot as the center of the setting, with the castle and the Round Table
- King Arthur as a just and legendary ruler, but with some human weaknesses
- The Knights of the Round Table as epic heroes with codes of honor and chivalric virtues
- Iconic characters such as Merlin, Morgana, Lancelot, Guinevere, etc.
- Driudic setting with sacred woods, ancient rituals and ancient Celtic beliefs
- Presence of enemies such as the invading Saxons or the evil Mordred
- Epic quests related to Arthurian legends (Grail quest, defense of Camelot, etc.)
- Court intrigues, betrayals and internal conflicts among knights
- Romantic and tragic elements in love stories (Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, etc.)

instructions:
- follow the compilation instructions in the square brackets
- fill all the empty tables
- everything else in the text should be left unchanged
- always consider that this is a solo tabletop roleplaying game
