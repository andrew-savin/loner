## Frequently Asked Questions

## Does Luck represent the character's Hit Points?

No, Luck represents a character's ability to escape adverse fate; it does not measure the physical ability to avoid or absorb damage.

This is why all characters in the game have exactly six Luck points: in the face of fate they are all equal!

By using Luck in a conflict you introduce a finite degree of uncertainty: when either side's points are exhausted the conflict is definitely ended against it.

This is just one way to introduce a turn-based conflict into a game based entirely on the Oracle, but always remember that there are two other modes of resolution: single-question sequence conflict and single-action resolution using the Oracle.

## Is it possible to tune a conflict by adjusting Luck points?

There is nothing in the game mechanics that prevents you from using less or more Luck points to define a character. If you want to calibrate an encounter in this way, you certainly can.

Just keep in mind that you are in fact deciding that character is unlucky or particularly lucky; you are not assigning him or her any physical prowess or increased stamina!

I suggest you embrace Luck for what it is and approach the conflict with sportsmanship!

## How does conflict take place against multiple opponents?

It depends primarily on the context of the situation at hand, but one possible technique is to treat a roster of opponents as a single "character," taking into account their characteristics such as Concept and Skill. Also keep in mind that a possible Fragility of such a character may be precisely their "numbers": the more members of a roster, the more difficult it is to coordinate actions!

## What is the difference between starting with a dramatic scene and setting up an "adventure frame"?

Think of the "frame" as a randomly generated mission using the classic [5 W Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) modified so that the "When" is replaced by a "How" and adding the Obstacle. This method provides a circumstantial premise that can trigger your imagination by already having mission objectives and principals in mind. 

Beginning with a dramatic scene is an old trick borrowed from fiction and film and often used by solo role-playing: it is easier to take your lead from a dynamic situation than from a static one.

Think of the opening scene of *Raiders of the Lost Ark*: Indiana Jones ventures into the temple of the golden idol and must overcome traps and puzzles. The mystery and tension are palpable and the character's every move is a risk. How equally effective would it have been to see Indiana Jones sitting in his living room consulting a book?

A quiet opening scene is not in itself inadvisable, but it provides far fewer cues on which to hook one's expectation, that is, fewer elements on which to question the oracle and keep the action moving forward.

Premise (or "frame") and "dramatic opening scene" are obviously not mutually exclusive, but they can also be used alternatively to kick-start the adventure.

## What is meant by "ask a closed question to solve each action" as an alternative to "Harm & Luck" rules?

It is an intermediate mode between using a single question question to resolve the entire conflict and using the more "playful" mechanics of classic point combat. 

Literally every action is resolved by questioning the oracle. For example, your protagonist engages in a firefight in an abandoned chemical factory by asking the following sequence of questions:

- "Can I take cover behind the wall?" Yes, but. *your line of fire is not clean, you have disadvantage*
- "I aim at the opponent, I can get the first shot in" No, but... *you disrupt his line of fire giving you advantage on the next shot*
- "I shoot the slag container over the opponent, do I get in?" Yes, and... *slag hits him full on knocking him out*

It is a more free-form mode, but also more unpredictable in outcomes.

## Is it possible to roll three or more Chance or Risk dice on the roll?

No, Loner is limited to a maximum of two Chance Dice or two Risk Dice per roll if an Advantage or Disadvantage comes into play.

If multiple positive or negative tags (including those derived from character traits and situational ones, as well as equipment) incur in a situation, these do not result in additional dice.

Similarly, the co-presence of one positive and one negative tag in the scene cancels each other out.

In summary:
- One or more positive tags net of negative ones: you roll with Advantage, two Chance Dice and one Risk Dice.
- One or more negative tags net of positive ones: you roll with Disadvantage, two Risk Dice and one Chance Dice.
- Positive and negative tags counterbalance (cancel) each other: you roll one Chance Die and one Risk Die.
