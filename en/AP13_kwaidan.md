## Special Rules

Consider the following as Luck-like scores, with a starting (and maximum) score of 6.

- **Chi**: Characters have a Chi score used to power supernatural abilities. Chi is drained by using abilities and recovered by meditation. 
- **Corruption**: Exposure to supernatural evil can corrupt the soul. Track corruption separately from health. Those fully corrupted may become monsters.
- **Honor**: Dishonorable acts drain Honor. Without honor, samurai lose status and peasants lose hope. Regaining honor may require quests.
