# Kwaidan!

Hey there, fellow adventurers! So, you might be wondering what this whole "Kwaidan" thing is, right? Well, get ready to step into a world of Japanese folklore like no other. Kwaidan is all about immersing yourself in a realm where ghosts, demons, and all sorts of mysterious creatures roam free. And guess what? It's a perfect match for our Loner Adventure Pack. Let me break it down for you.

Picture feudal Japan, a time of warring clans and hidden supernatural forces. It's like history and the supernatural decided to have a really intriguing party together. Kwaidan stories are like those spine-tingling tales you'd share around a campfire, but with a twist: samurais, peasants, and nobles grappling with things that go bump in the night.

Now, why is Kwaidan just right for those lone wolf characters? Well, think about it—loners have that extra touch of independence, right? They're the heroes who face the unknown solo, relying on their skills and uncovering mysteries that'd make others run for the hills. And in a world full of yokai (those shape-shifting critters) and spirits looking for trouble, loners are in for some serious action, banishing, and battling.

Kwaidan isn't just about spooky stuff; it's like a cultural journey through Japan's traditions, superstitions, and beliefs. You'll find yourself sipping tea in serene gardens, exploring the ins and outs of samurai and merchants, and keeping your cool while dealing with cursed artifacts and eerie shrines. Oh, and did I mention you might stumble upon secretive ninja clans and even have run-ins with mischievous tanuki? Yup, it's that wild.

So, if you're all about getting lost in worlds where reality and the supernatural mingle, Kwaidan is your go-to. And in our Loner Adventure Pack, you'll be the star of your very own spooky saga. Get ready for a journey where courage, smarts, and a sprinkle of the unknown can lead to epic challenges and victories. Kwaidan's here to whisk you away to a land where the unseen is waiting for you to uncover.

## Setting Information

- **Feudal Japan Amidst Conflict**: The stage is set in feudal Japan, a tumultuous era marked by the clash of warring clans. The land is steeped in political strife, where power struggles and territorial disputes are commonplace. Against this backdrop of unrest, something even more sinister stirs – shadowy supernatural forces that wield their own influence over the fate of the land.

- **Vulnerability of Remote Villages and Travelers**: Beyond the bustling cities and grand castles, the rural landscapes hide isolated villages and winding, lonely roads. As night falls, these places become particularly vulnerable to the unknown. Stories of eerie occurrences and unexplained phenomena abound, creating an atmosphere of tension and unease. The veil between the material world and the supernatural is thin in these desolate reaches, making them prime locations for encounters with otherworldly entities.

- **A World of Mystery and Danger**: The natural world is both breathtakingly beautiful and perilous in equal measure. Mist-shrouded forests, misty mountains, and hidden valleys hold untold mysteries, many of which are as dangerous as they are enchanting. Ancient legends and whispered tales warn of malevolent spirits lurking in the shadows, waiting to ensnare unsuspecting souls. Navigating this world requires not only physical prowess but also a keen understanding of the arcane.

- **Stratified Social Hierarchy**: Feudal society is deeply stratified, with a rigid social hierarchy dictating the roles and statuses of its inhabitants. At the pinnacle stand the revered samurai warriors and noble class, shaping the course of events with their political maneuvering and martial prowess. Beneath them, peasants and merchants toil, their lives governed by the decisions of those above. This stark division of power and influence has far-reaching implications for every facet of life in this era.

- **Influence of Folklore and Superstition**: The realm of superstition and folklore is interwoven into the very fabric of everyday existence. The beliefs and tales passed down through generations shape the perceptions and actions of individuals. Ghostly apparitions, demonic entities, and creatures that can transform from one form to another are not simply fantastical imaginings but tangible aspects of this world. Fear of the unknown and reverence for the spiritual underscore every interaction and decision.

- **Historical Landmarks and Turmoil**: The tumultuous history of the land is etched into its very soil. The echoes of pivotal battles and the rise of powerful warlords reverberate through the years, creating a sense of both grandeur and foreboding. Majestic castles and legendary battlegrounds serve as reminders of the struggles that have defined the era. Exploring these landmarks not only offers insight into the past but also a chance to uncover hidden truths that can illuminate the present challenges faced by the land.

## Special Rules

Consider the following as Luck-like scores, with a starting (and maximum) score of 6.

- **Chi**: Characters have a Chi score used to power supernatural abilities. Chi is drained by using abilities and recovered by meditation. 
- **Corruption**: Exposure to supernatural evil can corrupt the soul. Track corruption separately from health. Those fully corrupted may become monsters.
- **Honor**: Dishonorable acts drain Honor. Without honor, samurai lose status and peasants lose hope. Regaining honor may require quests.
