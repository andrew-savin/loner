## Consulting the Oracle: Diceless Version

This version doesn't use dice. It uses character abilities, narrative circumstances, and resources to determine outcomes. By using a decision matrix focused on diegetic elements, you maintain structured resolutions without random elements.

### Setup
- Define criteria for outcomes based on character traits, skills, and the current narrative.
- Use the decision matrix to evaluate these elements.

### Resolution

1. **Ask the Question:** The player asks a closed question that requires a resolution (e.g., "Is the door unlocked?").

2. **Evaluate Factors:**
- Assess relevant character traits and skills.
- Consider the current narrative circumstances.

3. **Decision Matrix:** Use the decision matrix based on character abilities and narrative context to determine the outcome.

4. **Twist Counter:** If the answer is "Yes, but..." add a point to the Twist Counter.

### Decision Matrix

| Player Factor/Action           | Influence | Outcome         |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Relevant Skill/Ability Present | High      | Yes             |
| Relevant Skill/Ability Absent  | Low       | No              |
| Favorable Circumstances        | Medium    | Yes, but...     |
| Unfavorable Circumstances      | Medium    | No, but...      |
| Exceptional Resources/Preparation | High   | Yes, and...     |
| Lack of Resources/Preparation  | Low       | No, and...      |

### Guidelines for Resolution

1. **Skill and Ability Check:**
   - If a character has a relevant skill or ability, the outcome leans towards **Yes**.
   - If the skill or ability is absent, the outcome leans towards **No**.

2. **Circumstances:** Assess the circumstances surrounding the question.
   - Favorable circumstances lean towards **Yes, but...**.
   - Unfavorable circumstances lean towards **No, but...**.

3. **Resources and Preparation:**
   - Exceptional resources or preparation lean towards **Yes, and...**.
   - Lack of resources or preparation lean towards **No, and...**.

### Resolution Example

- **Question:** "Is the door unlocked?"
- **Character Factors:** The character is a skilled locksmith (Relevant Skill Present).
- **Circumstances:** The door is sturdy (Unfavorable Circumstances).
- **Resources/Preparation:** The character has a complete set of high-quality lockpicking tools (Exceptional Resources).

**Outcome:** Based on the decision matrix:
- Relevant Skill Present: High influence towards **Yes**.
- Unfavorable Circumstances: Medium influence towards **No, but...**.
- Exceptional Resources: High influence towards **Yes, and...**.

**Final Decision:** The door is unlocked easily due to the character's skill and tools (**Yes, and...**).
