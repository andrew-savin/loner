# Cyberpunk Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The setting is a bleak and oppressive future where corporations have taken over the world and government control is minimal. This dystopian backdrop sets the tone for the game and informs the actions and motivations of the characters.
- The game takes place in a sprawling metropolis that is constantly alive with the hum of technology and the glare of neon lights. This city is a character in itself, full of towering skyscrapers, seedy alleyways, and underground clubs.
- In the world of Cyberpunk, cybernetic enhancements are commonplace, with many people opting to replace body parts with high-tech implants. This has created a divide between those who can afford the best enhancements and those who are forced to make do with lower-quality implants.
- Another key feature of the Cyberpunk world is the prevalence of virtual reality, which is used for entertainment, work, and communication. However, the virtual world can also be dangerous, with hackers and rogue AIs lurking in the digital shadows.
- The world of Cyberpunk is defined by power struggles between corporations, gangs, and underground movements. The characters in the game will need to navigate these conflicts and choose which side to take, or try to forge their own path in a world where power is everything.

## Special Rules

### Hacking

- **Accessing computer systems**: To hack into a computer system, players must first gain physical or wireless access to a terminal or network. They can then attempt to bypass security measures such as firewalls and encryption using their hacking skill or cybernetic enhancements.
- **Hacking actions**: Once a character has gained access to a computer system, they can perform a variety of hacking actions, such as downloading data, uploading viruses, or manipulating settings. Each action requires a successful hacking skill check or cybernetic implant use, with more complex actions.
- **Consequences of failure**: If a character fails a hacking skill check, they may trigger alarms, lock themselves out of the system, or even trigger countermeasures that can harm or incapacitate them. In some cases, a failed hacking attempt may alert powerful enemies or corporations to the character's activities, making it harder for them to achieve their goals.
- **Rewards of successful hacking**: If a character successfully hacks into a computer system, they may gain valuable information, disable security measures, or even take control of connected devices such as drones or security robots. This can be useful for completing missions, gathering intel, or gaining an edge in combat.
- **Consequences of detection**: If a character is detected while hacking, they may trigger alarms or attract the attention of powerful enemies or corporations. This can lead to increased security measures, retaliation from enemies, or even the loss of reputation. Characters must weigh the risks and rewards of hacking carefully and be prepared to deal with the consequences of their actions.

### Cybernetic Enhancements

- **Installation**: Characters can acquire Cybernetic Enhancements by visiting specialist clinics or underground markets. These enhancements can be installed in a variety of body parts, such as eyes, arms, legs, or even the brain. Each enhancement comes with a cost, and more advanced enhancements may require specialized installation procedures or additional cyberware.
- **Benefits**: Cybernetic Enhancements provide a variety of benefits, such as increased strength, speed, accuracy, or resilience. They may also grant unique abilities, such as the ability to see in the dark, detect hidden enemies, or even hack into computer systems directly.
- **Maintenance**: Cybernetic Enhancements require regular maintenance to function properly. Characters must visit clinics or have access to specialized tools to keep their cyberware in good condition. Failure to maintain cyberware can lead to malfunction or even bodily harm.
- **Risks**: Cybernetic Enhancements also come with risks. They may cause discomfort or pain, require regular medication or treatments, or even lead to addiction or mental instability. More advanced enhancements may also attract unwanted attention from corporations, governments, or criminal organizations.
- **Limits**: Cybernetic Enhancements have limits. Characters may not be able to use multiple enhancements at once or may suffer negative side effects if they push their enhancements too far. Additionally, cyberware may be vulnerable to hacking or EMP attacks, leaving characters vulnerable in certain situations. Characters must learn to use their enhancements wisely and be prepared to deal with the consequences of their choices.

### Implants

Consider each of the following as additional gear items.

1. **Neural Interface**: A direct interface between the brain and a computer system, allowing for direct control and manipulation of technology.
1. **Cybernetic Eyes**: Enhanced visual implants that allow for night vision, zooming, or even infrared vision.
1. **Cybernetic Limbs**: Artificial arms, legs, or other body parts that provide enhanced strength, speed, or agility.
1. **Neural Implant**: A chip implanted in the brain that enhances cognitive abilities, such as memory, calculation, or learning.

1. **Retinal Display**: An implant that displays information directly onto the character's retina, providing an augmented reality overlay of the world around them.
1. **Subdermal Armor**: A layer of armor implanted beneath the skin, providing additional protection against physical attacks.
1. **Cybernetic Organs**: Artificial organs that can replace or augment natural organs, providing increased strength, endurance, or resilience.
1. **Pain Suppressor**: An implant that suppresses pain signals, allowing characters to push through injuries and ignore physical discomfort.
1. **Adrenal Boost**: An implant that can trigger a surge of adrenaline, providing temporary boosts to strength, speed, or reflexes.
1. **Synthetic Blood**: An implant that replaces or enhances natural blood cells, providing increased oxygenation, stamina, or resistance to toxins.
1. **Bio-monitor**: An implant that constantly monitors the character's health, providing alerts for injuries, illnesses, or other health concerns.
1. **Reflex Booster**: An implant that enhances the character's reflexes, providing increased reaction time and agility.
1. **Sensory Enhancement**: An implant that enhances the character's senses, allowing for better hearing, smelling, or tasting.
1. **Cybernetic Spine**: An implant that replaces or augments the natural spine, providing increased strength, flexibility, or durability.
1. **Subdermal Weapon**: An implant that can conceal a small weapon, such as a knife or gun, beneath the skin.
1. **Datajack**: A jack implanted in the skull that allows for direct connection to a computer system, facilitating hacking and data manipulation.
1. **Cybernetic Heart**: An implant that replaces or enhances the natural heart, providing increased stamina, endurance, or resistance to heart-related illnesses.

### Reputation

- Reputation is a measure of how well-known and respected the character is in the world of cyberpunk. It can be gained through completing high-profile jobs, defeating powerful enemies, or making significant contributions to the community.
- Reputation is a double-edged sword, as it can also attract unwanted attention from rival factions, enemies, or law enforcement agencies. Players must weigh the benefits of gaining reputation against the risks of being targeted by powerful foes.
- Reputation can be used to gain access to exclusive locations, resources, and information. Characters with high reputation may be invited to elite clubs, receive job offers from powerful corporations, or be consulted by influential individuals.
- Reputation can also be lost if the character fails to live up to their reputation or if they engage in illegal or unethical activities. Players must be careful not to tarnish their reputation by engaging in risky behavior or making enemies with the wrong people.
- The reputation of the character can also affect the attitudes of NPCs towards them. Characters with high reputation may be treated with more respect and deference, while characters with low reputation may be shunned or even attacked on sight.
- Reputation levels are:
  - **Unknown**: The character is not well-known in the cyberpunk world and has not yet gained any reputation.
  - **Local**: The character has gained some reputation in a local area or community, but is not yet well-known outside of that region.
