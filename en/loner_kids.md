# **Loner: Kids**  
*A Simple Roleplaying Game for Kids (and Their Adults!)*  

## **What Is Loner: Kids?**  
_Loner: Kids_ is a simple and fun roleplaying game where a child gets to be the **Hero** of their own adventure! They’ll explore magical places, solve mysteries, and meet interesting friends (or silly troublemakers).  

They can play with an **adult** who helps tell the story, or they can play **by themselves** using a special “Yes/No/Maybe” system to see what happens next.  

In _Loner: Kids_, there are **no complicated rules**, just fun stories and exciting surprises!  

## **What You Need to Play**  
To play, you only need:  
✅ A **six-sided die (d6)** – Any standard die from a board game will work!  
✅ A **piece of paper** (or a notebook) – To draw your hero and write down cool things!  
✅ **Imagination!** – The most important tool!  

Optional:  
⭐ Stickers, tokens, or drawings to track hearts (health)  
⭐ Crayons to draw your adventure  

## **How to Make a Hero**  
Every hero needs a few special things. Ask your child these questions:  

1️⃣ **What’s their name?** – Pick a fun name, like “Ella the Explorer” or “Max the Brave.”  
2️⃣ **What are they really good at?** – Something special they can do! (Run fast? Talk to animals? Solve puzzles?)  
3️⃣ **What do they have?** – A special item! (A magic key? A shiny sword? A flying skateboard?)  
4️⃣ **What is their goal?** – What do they want to do in the adventure? (Find a lost puppy? Explore a pirate island? Get the best ice cream?)  

💡 **Draw a picture of your hero!** It makes them feel real.  

## **How to Play**  
A game of _Loner: Kids_ is all about telling a **story together**.  

👤 **If you’re playing with an adult**:  
- The child plays the Hero.  
- The adult describes the world, asks questions, and helps with surprises!  

🎭 **If playing alone**: The child rolls the die to decide what happens next!  

## **Ask a Question, Roll the Die!**  
Whenever something uncertain happens, roll the die!  

🎲 **1–2 = No.** It doesn’t work, or something goes wrong!  
🎲 **3–4 = Maybe.** It works, but there’s a little problem.  
🎲 **5–6 = Yes!** Success! Everything goes great.  

**Examples:**  
- “Can I jump over the river?” 🎲 Rolls a 2: *Oh no! You fall in!*  
- “Do I find the lost puppy?” 🎲 Rolls a 4: *Yes… but it’s stuck in a tree!*  
- “Can I climb up to save it?” 🎲 Rolls a 6: *Yes! You climb up easily!*  

You can also use **two different colored dice** (one for “Yes” and one for “No”), like in the grown-up *Loner* game, but one die is simpler for young kids.  

## **Surprises! (Twists in the Story)**  
Sometimes, something unexpected happens! You can add a **Surprise** when:  
🔹 The child rolls the same number twice in a row.  
🔹 The story feels like it needs a new problem or a fun event.  

✨ **Surprise Ideas:**  
- A **new friend** appears to help!  
- A **funny problem** happens! (The door is locked! The cake exploded!)  
- A **secret clue** is found!  

Let the child help decide **what happens next!**  

## **Heart Stickers (Health & Challenges)**  
Instead of numbers, use **hearts** (stickers, tokens, or drawings). Every Hero starts with **3 hearts**.  

❤️❤️❤️ → Full health!  
❤️❤️ → Uh-oh!  
❤️ → Danger!  

💔 If they lose all hearts, their Hero **takes a break**. Maybe they rest, get a hug, or find a friend to help. They can **earn hearts back** by resting, eating a snack, or solving a problem in a smart way.  

## **Making an Adventure**  
Adventures are made of simple **scenes**:  

1️⃣ The adult **describes the setting** (or the child makes one up).  
2️⃣ The Hero **tries something!**  
3️⃣ **Roll the die** to see what happens!  
4️⃣ The story **keeps going** until the goal is reached!  

**Example Adventure:**  
🌳 “You are in a magical forest. You need to find a hidden treasure! There are two paths: One is dark and spooky, the other is sunny and bright. Which way do you go?”  

(Child chooses a path.)  

🦉 “A talking owl blocks the way! He says you must solve a riddle to pass. Do you try to guess?”  

🎲 (Child rolls a 5 → “Yes!”)  
🦉 “Great! The owl is impressed and lets you through.”  

## **Winning the Game**  
There’s no “winning” or “losing.” The fun is in the **story**!  

When the child finishes their adventure, they can:  
🏅 Add a new **skill or item** to their Hero.  
📜 Draw a picture of what happened.  
🔄 Start a new adventure next time!  

💡 If they played solo, they can tell someone about their adventure—like a bedtime story!  

## **Loner Kids in Solo Mode**  
If a child wants to play alone, help them set up a simple system:  
✅ Draw **Yes / No / Maybe** cards (or make a simple spinner).  
✅ Use **stickers** or **tokens** to track hearts.  
✅ Let them tell the **whole story out loud** like a play!  

They don’t need rules—just a way to guide the adventure **without an adult telling them what happens**.  

## **Tips for Grown-Ups**  
🎭 **Act it out!** Use voices, gestures, and excitement.  
🤹 **Be flexible!** Let the child’s imagination lead.  
📖 **Let them tell the story!** Ask, “What happens next?”  
👏 **Celebrate their choices!** Even when things go wrong, make it fun.  

## **Example Playthrough**  
**Hero:** Mia the Brave Explorer (Good at climbing! Has a magic rope! Wants to find a lost baby dragon!)  

🎭 **Adult:** “Mia is in a deep jungle. Vines cover the trees, and she hears something tiny roaring in the distance. What does she do?”  
👧 **Child:** “I climb up a tree to look!”  
🎲 (Rolls a 3 → “Maybe.”)  
🎭 **Adult:** “You climb, but uh-oh! The tree is **wobbly**. You see the dragon, but you’re about to slip! What do you do?”  
👧 **Child:** “I grab a vine and swing to safety!”  
🎲 (Rolls a 6 → “Yes!”)  
🎭 **Adult:** “You swing like a superhero! Now you’re right next to the baby dragon—he looks scared. What do you say to him?”  
👧 **Child:** “Don’t be afraid! I’ll take you home.”  

🏆 The story keeps going until Mia helps the dragon find its family.  

## **Final Thoughts**  
_Loner: Kids_ is all about **making up fun stories** without complicated rules.  

Let kids be **creative**, **curious**, and **brave** in their own imaginary worlds. Whether they play with you or on their own, this game teaches them how to tell great stories and solve problems—one adventure at a time! 🚀
