It comes in two flavors:

- [Affinity Publisher Package](https://github.com/zeruhur/loner/blob/main/en/creators_kit/creators_kit_afpackage.zip): it maintains the original trade dress of Loner, including typefaces. You can you use it in accordance with the terms of the License or modify it. Make clear that your game is an independant production not affiliated with Zotiquest Games.
- [A raw txt file](https://github.com/zeruhur/loner/blob/main/en/creators_kit/loner_creator_kit.md): for those who want to develop the text before thinking about layouts.
