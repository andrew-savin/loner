## Setting Information

- **Alternate Victorian Era**: The setting takes place in a divergent Victorian era, where the progress of science and technology has been heavily driven by steam-powered innovations. This alternative history has led to a unique fusion of Victorian aesthetics and advanced machinery, resulting in a world that's both familiar and remarkably different.
- **Contrasting Landscapes**: The world itself is a tapestry of contrasting landscapes. Sprawling and opulent cities boast towering skyscrapers adorned with intricate clockwork details, powered by steam-driven engines. Vast factories dominate certain areas, where plumes of smoke mix with clouds in the sky. Beyond these urban centers lie untamed frontiers, wildernesses filled with the promise of adventure and the unknown.
- **Class Divisions**: The societal divide between the upper echelons and the working class is more pronounced than ever. The affluent elite bask in the benefits of technological marvels, enjoying luxurious airships for travel and opulent mechanical devices for comfort. In contrast, the laboring masses often toil in factories, operating these very machines but often deprived of their rewards.
- **Influence of Technology**: Technological advancements have significantly influenced the fabric of society. Inventors and engineers hold positions of prominence, their innovations shaping the course of history. The power and might of airship fleets transcend borders, with the skies becoming both a realm of exploration and a theater of conflict. Behind the scenes, secretive societies seek to harness and control the course of these advancements for their own agendas.
-  **Mechanical Wonders**: The world is a symphony of machinery. Clockwork creations crafted with precision roam the streets and fill workshops, while steam-powered vehicles and contraptions of all kinds traverse the urban sprawl. From towering automatons that assist in construction to elaborate transportation networks of gears and pulleys, the landscape is adorned with mechanical marvels that intertwine seamlessly with daily life.
- **Historical Impact**: The setting has been molded by pivotal moments in its history. The Great Steam Revolution, a turning point in society, marked a radical shift from traditional power sources to steam-driven mechanisms. The discovery of Etherium energy, a potent and enigmatic force, ushered in a new era of possibilities and challenges, altering the course of technological development and opening avenues for exploration into the aetheric realm.

## Special Rules

- **Steam Resonance**: Characters in this world are attuned to the energy of steam. They have a Steam Resonance score that determines their connection to technological devices. Characters can perform daring feats by channeling steam resonance, but overuse may lead to overheating and negative effects.
- **Clockwork Augmentations**: Characters can enhance their abilities through clockwork augmentations. These can range from steam-powered limbs for increased strength to cog-driven optics for improved perception. However, over-dependence on augmentations might lead to loss of organic abilities.
- **Cogwork Familiars**: Characters can have cogwork animal companions. These steam-powered familiars can assist in various tasks, from scouting to combat. Players need to manage their familiars' steam reserves and perform maintenance.
- **Smog Exposure**: The thick smog covering certain areas can be harmful. Characters exposed to prolonged smog might suffer from respiratory issues, reduced visibility, and even hallucinations. Protective gear and antidotes become essential.

## Optional Rules: Technomancing

In this world, the dance of gears and the power of steam have granted some individuals the ability to bridge the gap between technology and magic, a practice known as Technomancing. By channeling their understanding of both the aetheric energies and the inner workings of machinery, these Technomancers can achieve feats that others can only dream of.

Whenever you wish to employ your Technomantic talents, envision the outcome you desire. Channel your innate connection to machinery and the unseen aether, and pose a closed question to fate. Roll the dice, and let the range of possible answers guide your path:

- **1. No and**: Your attempt at Technomancy not only fails but also triggers an unforeseen complication, leading to unexpected consequences.
- **2. No**: Your efforts to harness Technomancy falter, yielding no discernible result.
- **3. No but**: While you don't achieve the desired outcome, your Technomantic influence leaves a subtle trace or advantage in the situation.
- **4. Yes but**: Your Technomantic abilities come through, though not entirely as you intended. There's a catch or limitation to your success.
- **5. Yes**: Your Technomancy works as intended, achieving the outcome you sought.
- **6. Yes and**: Not only does your Technomancy succeed, but it also grants you an unexpected bonus or opens up new opportunities.

### Aetheric Fatigue
