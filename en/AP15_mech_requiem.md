# Introduction

## Overview
_Mech Requiem_ unfolds in a future Earth, now fractured by decades of conflict and high-tech warfare. By the 2300s, the world has evolved into a complex web of alliances and rivalries among great powers, leading to a continuous state of proxy wars fought through advanced technology and specialized mechs.

## Key Setting Points

1. **World Powers and Politics**:
   - Earth is divided among several Great Powers, successors to today’s nations, each with its own ideologies, economies, and military capabilities.
   - The primary conflict exists between two dominant blocs, each backed by different sets of alliances and treaties. These blocs engage primarily through proxy wars to exert influence and gain resources without triggering a full-scale war.

2. **Technological Landscape**:
   - The setting is marked by advanced technology, especially in terms of warfare. This includes sophisticated AI, cyber warfare capabilities, and high-tech surveillance.
   - Mechs are the pinnacle of military technology, used due to their ability to perform in varied terrains and conditions where traditional vehicles and infantry cannot.

3. **Mech Warfare**:
   - Mechs vary in design and function, ranging from agile reconnaissance types to heavy artillery platforms.
   - Due to the high risk of nuclear escalation, these machines are essential for ground operations, capable of carrying out precision strikes, defense operations, and sabotage.

4. **Societal Impact**:
   - Despite technological advances, the quality of life varies significantly. Metropolitan areas of Great Powers enjoy relative prosperity and technological comforts, while war-torn regions suffer from poverty, destruction, and constant threat.
   - The global economy is heavily militarized, with major industries revolving around the production and maintenance of military tech, especially mechs.

5. **Proxy Wars**:
   - Proxy wars have been raging for about 20 years, with smaller nations and factions sponsored by the Great Powers to fight their battles. These conflicts are often used to test new military technologies and tactics.
   - Full-scale war has been avoided mainly due to the threat of mutual destruction, especially with nuclear weapons still being a deterrent, though unused actively.

6. **Environmental and Cultural Background**:
   - The environmental toll of centuries of industrialization and warfare has transformed many landscapes, leading to new challenges in survival and combat.
   - Different cultures have adapted uniquely to the rise of mech technology, with some venerating mech pilots as heroes or symbols of national pride, while others view them as necessary evils of the ongoing wars.

## Playable Themes

For players in _Mech Requiem_, these minor nations and their proxy wars provide rich narrative soil. Players can engage in stories that explore:
  
- **Diplomacy and Espionage**: Navigating the delicate politics of alliances and subterfuge, influencing local leaders, or uncovering plots that could shift the balance of power.
  
- **Guerrilla Warfare and Mech Operations**: Participating in asymmetric warfare, leading or advising resistance movements, or piloting specialized mechs designed for guerrilla tactics.
  
- **Humanitarian Missions**: Addressing the consequences of war, from rescuing civilians to rebuilding after conflicts, offering a different perspective on the cost of high-tech warfare.

# Characters

Before you embark on your journey through the war-torn landscapes, soar above the devastated cities, or navigate the treacherous waters of the _Mech Requiem_*_ era, let’s explore how you can craft and manage your Protagonist and other characters. This guide will equip you with the tools to shape their traits, hone their skills, and prepare them for the challenges that lie ahead in this tumultuous world.

### Everything is a Character!

In _Mech Requiem_ Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too! (But remember that mechs follow special rules, see below!)

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

# Rules

_Mech Requiem_ is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

## Keep The Action In Motion

A game in _Mech Requiem_ is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In _Mech Requiem_ at each scene:

1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

## Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

## Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

## Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

## Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below (**this does not apply to Mech Conflicts!**).

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

## Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

## Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the following tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

| Verbs |     1    |    2    |    3    |     4    |    5    |    6    |
|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   1   |  command  |  navigate |   hack   |  deploy  |   fortify  |  salvage |
|   2   | operate   |  synthesize |   interrogate | fortify | encode | strategize |
|   3   |  augment  |  recalibrate | substitute | sabotage | reconstruct | maneuver |

|   6   |     key    |  revenue |   function  |  anomaly | strategy | confrontation |

## When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Mech Specific Rules

### Mech Conflict Resolution

Mech Conflicts, a pivotal aspect of gameplay in _Mech Requiem_, can be resolved in one of two ways:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.

When determining the outcome of mech battles, consider the various tags associated with each mech (see below). These tags help establish whether you have an Advantage or a Disadvantage in the conflict based on a positive balance of factors.

**It’s also important to take into account the pilot’s attributes**. For instance, an experienced pilot might tip the scales in your favor, offering additional Chances, as opposed to a War Correspondent who might find themselves at a disadvantage due to their lack of combat piloting experience.

### Advanced Damage System

In _Mech Requiem_, the damage system is designed to be immersive and detailed, enhancing the gameplay by dividing mech damage into four critical areas: Mobility, Weapons Systems, Sensors, and Armor. This categorization aligns with the tag-based, non-numeric mechanics of the game, ensuring a deep, narrative-driven experience.

#### Damage Categories and Tags

**Mobility:**

Damage to a mech’s mobility affects its ability to navigate and maneuver on the battlefield. This is reflected through tags such as:

- **Slowed:** Movement capabilities are reduced.
- **Impaired Thrusters:** Compromised aerial or jumping capabilities.
- **Damaged Actuators:** Difficulty navigating complex terrain.
- **Seized Joints:** Movement is severely restricted.
- **Unstable:** Challenges in maintaining balance, impacting combat effectiveness.

**Weapons **Systems:**

Effective engagement in combat relies on functioning weapons systems. Damage here is tagged as:

- **Jammed Weapons:** Ranged weapons fail to operate.
- **Misaligned Optics:** Reduced accuracy.
- **Overheated Barrels:** Requires cooling between uses.
- **Depleted Ammunition:** Ammunition reserves are low.
- **Disabled Primary Weapon:** The primary weapon system is non-functional.

**Sensors:**

Sensors provide critical battlefield awareness and targeting accuracy. Sensor damage can include:

- **Blurred Vision:** Visual feeds are distorted.
- **Sensor Ghosts:** False readings create confusion.
- **Communication Disruption:** Hindered data transmission.
- **Radar Blindness:** Loss of long-range detection.
- **Full Sensor Blackout:** Complete failure of detection systems.

**Armor:**

Armor integrity is crucial for mech durability and internal system protection. Armor damage involves:

- **Cracked Plating:** Minor but worsening breaches in armor.
- **Exposed Circuitry:** Critical internal wiring is unprotected.
- **Breached Hull:** Significant structural damage.
- **Compromised Integrity:** Major structural weaknesses.
- **Critical **Vulnerability:** Increased susceptibility to attacks.

#### Managing Damage

Damage tags influence mech performance and require active management and repair to maintain operational effectiveness. Players must utilize in-game resources such as repair kits or seek assistance from allied units. Some damages may only be repairable under specific conditions, such as within a dedicated mech hangar.

#### Gameplay Impact

The introduction of detailed damage tags compels players to make strategic decisions influenced by the condition of their mechs. A mech tagged as "Slowed" must avoid scenarios where speed is crucial, and one with "Jammed Weapons" might need to retreat or find alternative combat strategies. This system enriches the tactical gameplay and narrative depth, providing both challenges and opportunities for recovery and adaptation throughout the campaign.

### Mech Maintenance and Repair

After each encounter or mission, your mech must undergo a maintenance check to assess its readiness for further operations. This process determines if any damage or stress endured during the mission has resulted in lasting effects that could hinder the mech's performance in subsequent scenes.

#### Implementing Maintenance Checks
Maintenance checks are performed by consulting the Oracle. To begin a maintenance check, consider the following factors:
- **Extent of Damage Taken:** How heavily was the mech damaged in the encounter?
- **Environmental Effects:** Were there environmental conditions that could have exacerbated wear or damage, such as extreme temperatures, corrosive atmospheres, or rough terrain?
- **Maintenance History:** Has the mech been consistently well-maintained, or has it suffered from neglect or patchwork repairs?

Based on these factors, roll and consult the Oracle with a question framed around the mech's readiness, such as "Is the mech fully operational after the mission?" Adjust the difficulty of the maintenance check based on the severity of the conditions the mech was exposed to.

#### Maintenance Outcomes Table
When performing a maintenance check, use the following table to determine the outcome. Roll 2d6 and adjust the roll by applying relevant tags from the encounter (e.g., add a die if the mech was minimally damaged or subtract a die if the mech endured significant stress or environmental hazards).

| Roll Result | Condition and Tags Applied |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| 2-3         | **Critical Failure:** Major malfunctions present. Apply tags such as "Systems Offline" or "Major Repairs Needed." |
| 4-5         | **Poor Condition:** Several issues detected. Apply tags like "Reduced Mobility" or "Sensor Interference." |
| 6-8         | **Fair Condition:** Minor issues that may affect performance. Apply a tag such as "Routine Maintenance Required." |
| 9-10        | **Good Condition:** Mech is mostly operational but could benefit from minor tweaks. No adverse tags applied, perhaps a beneficial tag like "Tuned Systems." |
| 11-12       | **Excellent Condition:** Mech is in top condition. Apply beneficial tags such as "Optimal Performance" or "Enhanced Response Systems." |

#### Effect of Maintenance on Gameplay
The condition of the mech as determined by the maintenance check influences the next scene or mission. A mech in poor condition might face challenges like slower speeds or reduced combat effectiveness, while a mech in excellent condition could perform better than expected, offering strategic or tactical advantages.

### Resource Management

Players are responsible for managing essential resources for their mechs, including fuel, ammunition, and repair materials. These resources will deplete with each use, reflecting the consumption during missions, encounters, or as a result of damage sustained. Players must actively monitor and replenish these resources to ensure their mech remains combat-effective and mission-ready.

#### Implementing Resource Tracking
Each mech is assigned specific resource levels that represent the quantity of fuel, ammunition, and repair materials available at the start of the game. These levels are expressed through tags that indicate the relative abundance or scarcity of each resource.

- **Fuel**: Tags such as "Full Tanks," "Half-Empty Tanks," or "Running Low."
- **Ammunition**: Tags like "Fully Armed," "Ammo at Half Capacity," or "Low on Ammo."
- **Repair Materials**: Tags including "Adequate Supplies," "Limited Repair Kits," or "Critical Shortage of Parts."

During gameplay, these tags are adjusted based on mech activities. For example, engaging in a prolonged battle might change an ammunition tag from "Fully Armed" to "Low on Ammo."

#### Managing Resources Through Gameplay
Players can replenish and manage their resources through several interactive gameplay activities:

- **Missions**: Specific missions may be undertaken with the primary objective of securing resources. Successfully completing these missions can improve resource tags, e.g., recovering a supply cache might change "Low on Ammo" to "Fully Armed."

- **Trading**: Players can engage in trading with other factions or entities within the game. This could involve trading surplus resources for those in shorter supply, or negotiating for parts and materials needed for repairs.

- **Scavenging**: In post-battle scenarios or while exploring derelict sites, players can scavenge for resources. This activity involves risk, as it may expose the mech and pilot to unexpected dangers.

- **Conservation Strategies**: Players might adopt conservation strategies such as using melee weapons to save ammunition or limiting movement to conserve fuel. Such decisions should be reflected in the narrative and can influence the outcome of missions.

### Environmental Impact

Environmental factors such as terrain type, weather conditions, and battlefield remnants like craters or fires can dramatically impact mech operations. These elements can either enhance mech capabilities under favorable conditions or pose additional hurdles under less favorable ones.

#### Implementing Environmental Conditions
At the beginning of each encounter or scene, the player will determine the environmental conditions that will affect the gameplay. This is done by rolling on predefined tables or through descriptive storytelling, depending on the scenario's needs.

- **Terrain Effects**: Different terrains like urban ruins, dense forests, mountainous areas, or open plains will affect mobility and visibility. For example, urban ruins might provide cover but restrict movement, imposing a "Restricted Mobility" tag, while open plains might increase vulnerability but allow for higher speeds, adding a "Enhanced Speed" tag.
  
- **Weather Conditions**: Weather can play a crucial role in mech operations. Heavy rain might impose a "Reduced Visibility" tag, while fog could provide a "Stealth Advantage" tag. Extreme conditions like a sandstorm or blizzard might combine multiple challenging tags such as "Severely Reduced Visibility" and "Mobility Impairment."
  
- **Localized Damage**: Areas affected by previous battles might have craters, fires, or chemical spills. A crater might lead to a "Rough Terrain" tag that affects mobility, while fires could risk additional damage, imposing a "Heat Damage Risk" tag.

#### Modifying Mech and Pilot Performance
Once the environmental conditions are established, they directly influence mech and pilot performance through the application of specific tags. These tags are temporary and last for the duration of the encounter or until the environmental conditions change. Players must adapt their tactics based on these tags:

- **Advantages**: Some environmental conditions might play to the strengths of certain mechs. For instance, a mech designed for urban combat might receive a "Tactical Superiority" tag in city ruins, enhancing its effectiveness.
  
- **Challenges**: Conversely, adverse conditions can challenge players to innovate or find workarounds. A mech not suited for aquatic environments might struggle in a flooded area, receiving a "Reduced Functionality" tag until it moves to a more suitable location or the conditions are mitigated.

### Enviromental Conditions Tables

To effectively integrate environmental conditions into gameplay for _Mech Requiem_, let's create specific tables using dice rolls to determine various environmental factors. These tables use d6 (six-sided dice) to maintain simplicity and accessibility. Each category—Terrain Effects, Weather Conditions, and Localized Damage—will have its own table to determine the impact on mech operations.

- At the start of each encounter or mission, the player rolls according to the appropriate table to determine the environmental conditions. This random element adds a layer of unpredictability and requires players to adapt their strategies.
- The tags assigned by these conditions should meaningfully impact the decisions players make during gameplay, affecting movement, combat effectiveness, and visibility.
- These environmental tags last for the duration of the encounter or until conditions are narratively changed by the game master or through events in the storyline.

#### Terrain Effects Table
Roll 1d6 to determine the terrain type encountered, which will impose specific tags affecting gameplay.

| Roll | Terrain Type         | Impact Tag                 |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 1    | Urban Ruins          | "Restricted Mobility"      |
| 2    | Dense Forest         | "Reduced Visibility"       |
| 3    | Mountainous Area     | "Challenging Navigation"   |
| 4    | Open Plains          | "Enhanced Speed"           |
| 5    | Swampy Terrain       | "Severely Restricted Mobility" |
| 6    | Rocky Terrain        | "Rough Terrain"            |

#### Weather Conditions Table
Roll 2d6 for a more nuanced result reflecting the variety of weather conditions possible.

| Roll | Weather Condition | Impact Tag                     |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2-3  | Heavy Rain        | "Reduced Visibility"           |
| 4-5  | Fog               | "Stealth Advantage"            |
| 6-7  | Clear Skies       | "Optimal Operation"            |
| 8-9  | Windy             | "Aiming Difficulty"            |
| 10-11| Sandstorm         | "Severely Reduced Visibility", "Mobility Impairment" |
| 12   | Blizzard          | "Severely Reduced Visibility", "Mobility Impairment", "Cold Operation Risk" |

#### Localized Damage Table
Roll 1d6 to determine the type of localized damage or battlefield remnants that influence mech operations.

| Roll | Damage Type    | Impact Tag                    |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | Craters        | "Rough Terrain"               |
| 2    | Fires          | "Heat Damage Risk"            |
| 3    | Chemical Spills| "Contamination Risk"          |
| 4    | Rubble         | "Obstructed Paths"            |
| 5    | Flooded Area   | "Impaired Mobility", "Increased Stealth" |
| 6    | Electrical Storm Area | "Sensor Interference", "Increased Electrical Risk" |

### Customization and Upgrades

Players can customize and upgrade their mechs by selecting enhancements from a variety of systems and armaments. These upgrades are not just aesthetic; they significantly affect mech capabilities, performance, and role in combat and missions. Upgrades can be obtained through experience gained in battle, discoveries made during missions, and resources secured throughout the campaign.

To facilitate this, _Mech Requiem_ includes a tech tree or upgrade path for each mech, categorized by systems such as weapons, armor, sensors, mobility, and utility systems. Each category offers a range of upgrades that provide distinct advantages but also come with specific prerequisites and costs:

- **Tech Tree Structure**: Each mech starts with a basic set of capabilities and a number of potential upgrade paths. These paths might include improvements like enhanced armor plating, advanced targeting systems, or stealth capabilities. Each path has several stages, with each stage offering increased benefits.

- **Resource Requirements**: Upgrades require resources, which must be managed carefully throughout the game. Resources might include salvage materials, currency, or rare components obtained from missions. Some high-tier upgrades might also require special items or knowledge gained from specific narrative developments.

- **Prerequisites**: Certain upgrades may have prerequisites, such as achieving a particular milestone in the story, completing specific types of missions, or previously installing certain lower-tier upgrades. This system encourages strategic long-term planning and investment in mech development.

- **Customization Tags**: When an upgrade is applied, it modifies the mech’s tags accordingly. For example, upgrading from "Standard Plating" to "Reinforced Armor Plating" might change the tag from “Basic Protection” to “Enhanced Durability.” These tags directly influence gameplay, affecting how a mech performs in various situations.
