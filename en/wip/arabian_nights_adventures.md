# Arabian Nights Adventures

***Arabian Nights Adventures*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world inspired by the enchanting tales of the Arabian Nights.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be a quick, immersive, and flexible experience where you explore a rich tapestry of exotic locations, diverse cultures, mythical beings, and thrilling adventures.

## Introduction

*Arabian Nights Adventures* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Arabian Nights Adventures** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Cunning Merchant" or "Fierce Warrior."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Arabian Nights Adventures* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Arabian Nights Adventures* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Characters

In *Arabian Nights Adventures*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Arabian Nights Adventures* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Arabian Nights Adventures* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Arabian Nights Adventures* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Magic and Wishes

Magic is an integral part of the world in *Arabian Nights Adventures*, often manifesting through encounters with Djinns or the discovery of magical items that grant wishes. Each wish is a double-edged sword, requiring precise wording to avoid unintended consequences.

- **Wish Test**: When a character makes a wish, they must test their expectations using the Oracle system. Advantage or disadvantage can be added based on the character's knowledge of magic, prior interactions with Djinns, and the specific context of the wish.
  - **Yes**: The wish is granted as intended.
  - **No**: The wish is denied or fails spectacularly.
  - **Yes, but...**: The wish is granted, but with an unforeseen complication or cost.
  - **Yes, and...**: The wish is granted perfectly, with additional positive outcomes.
  - **No, but...**: The wish fails, but some minor benefit is gained.
  - **No, and...**: The wish fails disastrously, with additional negative consequences.
- **Consequences of Wishes**: Poorly phrased wishes can lead to unexpected twists, such as turning allies into enemies or creating new challenges. Wisely used wishes can enhance the character's journey, providing aid or revealing secrets.

### Desert Survival

The harsh desert environment in *Arabian Nights Adventures* presents significant challenges that characters must overcome. Proper planning and resource management are crucial for survival.

- **Survival Test**: When characters traverse the desert, they must test their expectations using the Oracle system. Advantage or disadvantage can be added based on their preparation, survival skills, and environmental conditions.
  - **Yes**: The journey proceeds smoothly with no significant issues.
  - **No**: The journey is fraught with difficulties, leading to loss of supplies or exhaustion.
  - **Yes, but...**: The journey is successful, but with minor setbacks such as minor injuries or delays.
  - **Yes, and...**: The journey is highly successful, leading to discoveries or encounters with helpful nomads.
  - **No, but...**: The journey faces obstacles, but some supplies or help mitigate the problems.
  - **No, and...**: The journey is disastrous, leading to major loss of supplies or severe danger.
- **Resource Management**: Characters must carefully manage their water and food supplies. Encounters with sandstorms, hostile creatures, or finding an oasis can impact their survival, requiring adaptive strategies.

### Palace Intrigue

Navigating the intricate social and political landscapes of the cities and palaces in *Arabian Nights Adventures* is essential. Characters must use their wits and charm to maneuver through these complex environments.

- **Intrigue Test**: When engaging in social or political maneuvers, characters must test their expectations using the Oracle system. Advantage or disadvantage can be added based on their reputation, alliances, and the specific context of the intrigue.
  - **Yes**: The character successfully navigates the intrigue, gaining favor or outmaneuvering rivals.
  - **No**: The character fails, leading to loss of favor or falling into a trap.
  - **Yes, but...**: The character achieves their goal, but at a personal cost or creating a new rival.
  - **Yes, and...**: The character gains additional influence or uncovers a valuable secret.
  - **No, but...**: The character fails but manages to avoid severe repercussions.
  - **No, and...**: The character's failure leads to significant negative consequences, such as exposure or enmity.
- **Reputation and Alliances**: Successfully navigating palace intrigues enhances the character's reputation, leading to increased influence and support. Conversely, failure can result in loss of allies or becoming a target for rivals.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
