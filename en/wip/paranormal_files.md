# **Loner: Paranormal Files**  

***Loner: Paranormal Files*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world where secret organizations investigate, contain, and sometimes battle the unexplained. From reality-warping anomalies to cryptic artifacts and otherworldly entities, you step into the role of an investigator navigating a shadowy world of conspiracies, classified incidents, and unsettling truths.  

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be a **narrative-driven experience of suspense, discovery, and cosmic horror**, where you piece together fragmented evidence, confront the unknown, and determine what must remain hidden from the public.  

## **Introduction**  

***Loner: Paranormal Files*** follows the following design principles:  

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.  
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one resolving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.  
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and not by quantitative characteristics.  

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Paranormal Files** throws you headfirst into the heart of the unknown. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *“Cynical Field Agent,”* *“Occult Archivist,”* or *“Unorthodox Scientist.”*  

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Paranormal Files* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Paranormal Files* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## **Setting Introduction**  

The world of *Loner: Paranormal Files* is one of hidden truths, classified encounters, and organizations working behind the scenes to contain the unexplainable. Paranormal activity is real, but the public must never know. Investigators, agents, and field operatives are tasked with studying, neutralizing, or exploiting anomalies that defy logic—sometimes at great personal cost.  

### **Core Aspects of the Setting**  

- **The Veil of Secrecy**  
  - Government agencies, private institutions, and secret societies work tirelessly to keep paranormal phenomena hidden from the general public.  
  - The media is manipulated, witnesses are silenced, and fabricated cover stories ensure that what lurks in the shadows stays there.  

- **Anomalies, Entities, and Artifacts**  
  - Paranormal activity manifests in many forms: **dimensional breaches, possessed artifacts, cryptids, psychic disturbances, and extraterrestrial visitations**.  
  - Not all anomalies are hostile—some are misunderstood, others are neutral, and a rare few can be harnessed for human advancement.  
  - Scientific explanations are pursued, but many cases remain unsolved, existing beyond human comprehension.  

- **The Organizations and Their Agendas**  
  - Various groups investigate, contain, or exploit the unknown:  
    - **Government Agencies** (e.g., “Bureau of Paranormal Affairs”) enforce secrecy and control.  
    - **Private Research Firms** study anomalies for military or corporate gain.  
    - **Occult Societies** believe some forces should be worshiped rather than contained.  
    - **Insurgent Groups** attempt to expose the truth, believing that knowledge belongs to humanity.  
  - Conflicts between these factions create layers of intrigue, moral dilemmas, and shifting alliances.  

- **The Cost of Knowing**  
  - Investigators often **experience psychological distress**, from paranoia and insomnia to full mental breakdowns.  
  - Exposure to anomalies can lead to **mutation, madness, or enlightenment**—sometimes all three.  
  - The deeper you dig, the more you question reality, morality, and the very fabric of existence.

## **Characters**  

In *Loner: Paranormal Files*, you are an **investigator of the unknown**, navigating a world where reality bends, secrets are buried, and the cost of knowledge is often irreversible. Whether you are a hardened field agent, an eccentric scientist, or a whistleblower seeking the truth, your role is to confront the inexplicable—sometimes to contain it, sometimes to understand it, and sometimes simply to survive.  

Every operative, researcher, or rogue investigator brings their own expertise and weaknesses to the field. Some wield advanced technology, others rely on ancient rituals, and a few have experienced anomalies firsthand—leaving them permanently changed.  

As an investigator, you will be:  

- **Unraveling classified files, cryptic transmissions, and recovered artifacts.**  
- **Tracking anomalies, rogue agents, and supernatural threats in the field.**  
- **Deciding whether to protect the public—or expose the truth at all costs.**  
- **Facing moral dilemmas, from ethical containment to lethal cover-ups.**  
- **Surviving the psychological and physical toll of dealing with forces beyond comprehension.**  

No one walks away unchanged. The deeper you go, the more you must question:  
**What is real? What is a lie? And will you recognize yourself when it's over?**  

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Paranormal Files* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Loner: Paranormal Files* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Paranormal Files* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Paranormal Files* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### **Setting Related Rules**  

The world of *Loner: Paranormal Files* operates on rules that balance **rational investigation** with **unpredictable anomalies**, **classified knowledge**, and **unseen forces** that may work for—or against—the investigator. The oracular system will be used to determine **paranormal interactions, containment outcomes, cover-up effectiveness, and mental resilience.**  

---

#### **The Unknown Threshold**  

In paranormal investigations, reality is **not always stable**. The **Unknown Threshold** represents the line between what is understood and what remains beyond comprehension.  

- At the beginning of an investigation, set the **Unknown Threshold** at **0**.  
- Each time the investigator **witnesses, interacts with, or fails to contain an anomaly**, roll the Oracle:  
  - **Yes, and...** → You maintain control. Reduce the Threshold.  
  - **Yes...** → You resist the effects. No change.  
  - **Yes, but...** → You are affected but still functional. Increase the Threshold by **1**.  
  - **No, but...** → A minor distortion in reality occurs. Increase the Threshold by **2**.  
  - **No...** → You suffer an **Unstable Encounter**. Increase the Threshold by **3**.  
  - **No, and...** → Reality **fractures** around you. The Unknown Threshold increases by **4**.  

🛑 **When the Unknown Threshold reaches 6**, the investigator must roll on the **Reality Fracture Table** (see below).  

---

#### **Reality Fracture Table**  

When exposed to **too much instability**, the investigator risks **mental breaks, hallucinations, or unwanted attunement** to the anomaly’s frequency. Roll 1d6 and consult the chart:  

| **D6** | **Reality Fracture Effect** |
| --- | ---------------------------- |
| 1 | **Echoes of the Unseen** - You hear voices or sounds from an alternate reality, but you can’t determine if they are real or hallucinations. |
| 2 | **Dimensional Bleed** - Objects around you temporarily flicker, revealing glimpses of another timeline. |
| 3 | **Lost Time** - You black out for an unknown duration. Something may have changed in the world while you were gone. |
| 4 | **Cognitive Drift** - You struggle to recall basic details, and your memories feel like they belong to someone else. |
| 5 | **Marked by the Unknown** - An unseen force now recognizes you. Entities may respond differently to your presence. |
| 6 | **The Door Opens** - A temporary rift forms, allowing something **in**—or pulling you **out**. |

A **successful Oracle roll** can **reduce** the effects of Reality Fracture over time, but some investigators **never fully recover**.  

---

#### **Anomaly Interaction Rules**  

When **interacting with an anomaly**—whether a cryptid, artifact, extradimensional rift, or an unexplained event—use the **Paranormal Interaction Table** to determine the outcome.  

| **Situation** | **Roll the Oracle** | **Outcome Examples** |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Direct Contact** (touching, using, or experiencing the anomaly) | **Yes, and...** → Gain knowledge without harm. / **No, and...** → Severe consequences, permanent change. |
| **Observation** (studying from a safe distance) | **Yes, but...** → You gain partial information but are affected in a small way. |
| **Containment Attempt** (securing or neutralizing an anomaly) | **No, but...** → The anomaly resists containment but does not escalate… yet. |
| **Suppression & Cover-Up** (erasing public knowledge) | **Yes, and...** → The cover-up is perfect. / **No, and...** → Leaks occur, leading to faction conflict. |
| **Mental Resistance** (avoiding hallucinations, psychic damage, or forced insight) | **No, but...** → You are changed, but still in control. |

Each interaction raises **the stakes**—some anomalies are **sentient**, some **react to awareness**, and others may **rewrite reality just by being observed**.  

---

### **Cover-Ups & Information Control**  

Secrecy is paramount. Every **classified event, leaked document, or discovered truth** can alter **who controls the narrative**.  

When **attempting a cover-up**, roll the Oracle:  

- **Yes, and...** → The story is erased completely, and no one remembers the truth.  
- **Yes...** → The cover-up holds, but whispers remain.  
- **Yes, but...** → Conspiracies emerge, forcing additional damage control.  
- **No, but...** → An opposing faction discovers the cover-up attempt and takes action.  
- **No...** → The public catches wind, and mass panic or rogue investigations begin.  
- **No, and...** → The cover-up **backfires spectacularly**—leading to a power shift, internal betrayal, or mass exposure of paranormal activity.  

Depending on the outcome, **factions, rogue agents, and external forces may intervene**.  

---

#### **Factions & Influence**  

In the world of *Loner: Paranormal Files*, **powerful organizations** dictate how the unknown is handled. These factions constantly **manipulate, infiltrate, and oppose each other**.  

Every investigator has a **Reputation Level** with each faction, ranging from **-3 (Enemy) to +3 (Trusted Agent)**.  

- A **-3 Reputation** means **active hostility**—the faction may attempt to eliminate or discredit you.  
- A **+3 Reputation** means **high trust**—they provide special resources, clearance, and backup.  

When engaging with factions, roll the Oracle:  

- **Yes, and...** → The faction provides extra resources, protection, or secrets.  
- **Yes...** → The faction accepts your request or aids you.

#### **Corruption & Exposure to the Paranormal**  

Long-term exposure to **paranormal anomalies, mind-altering forces, or classified knowledge** takes a toll on **both mind and body**.  

Every time an investigator is **exposed to a severe anomaly**, they must roll the Oracle:  

| **Oracle Result** | **Psychological Effect** | **Physical Effect** |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | You resist without consequence. | No physical effect. |
| **Yes...** | You suppress the trauma, but it lingers. | Temporary exhaustion or mild nausea. |
| **Yes, but...** | You suffer **mild paranoia, headaches, or memory gaps**. | Minor physical mutations (odd bruises, enhanced perception). |
| **No, but...** | You experience **severe hallucinations, paranoia, or nightmares**. | Physical distress (nosebleeds, tremors, light sensitivity). |
| **No...** | You develop **obsessive behaviors or extreme reactions** to anomalies. | Physical alteration (permanent discoloration, a mark that wasn’t there before). |
| **No, and...** | You lose part of yourself—memories, identity, or reality perception. | Your body **begins to change**, and you may no longer be fully human. |

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## **Setting Information**  

The world you operate in is **not the world as the public knows it**. While society functions as usual, there exists an **underbelly of classified investigations, shadow agencies, and suppressed knowledge** that governs reality from behind the scenes.  

Those who investigate anomalies understand one rule: **there are things humanity was never meant to know**—and those who do **rarely remain unchanged**.  

---

### **Anomalous Zones & Classified Locations**  

Not all places on Earth obey the **rules of time, space, or logic**. Some locations have been **permanently altered by anomalies**, while others appear and disappear according to unknowable patterns.  

#### **Examples of Anomalous Zones:**  
- **Redacted Cities** – Entire urban areas where time loops, residents repeat scripted behaviors, and new buildings **construct themselves overnight**.  
- **The Veil Corridors** – A subterranean tunnel system that **connects locations that should not be geographically linked**.  
- **The Hollow Prison** – A classified site where prisoners disappear from security footage, leaving only **empty jumpsuits and static-filled last words**.  
- **The Horizon Event** – A highway stretch where travelers find themselves in **a different decade** after passing the same exit three times.  
- **Abandoned Research Facilities** – Buildings once dedicated to **studying anomalies**, now sealed shut, with reports of **static whispers from the inside**.  

These locations are **studied, contained, or erased from public records**, depending on the agendas of the organizations involved. Some sites are **too dangerous to be touched**, others are **testing grounds for classified experiments**, and some… **watch those who watch them**.  

---

### **Organizations & Secret Factions**  

The world is controlled by those who know the truth—and **fight over who gets to keep it**.  

#### **Major Types of Organizations:**  
- **Government Paranormal Divisions** – Bureaucratic agencies that **classify, study, and contain anomalies**, operating in the shadows of major world governments.  
- **Private Research Firms** – Corporations that **see anomalies as untapped resources**, conducting illegal experiments and **auctioning off supernatural technology** to the highest bidder.  
- **Occult Societies** – Groups that believe anomalies are **divine, demonic, or the key to enlightenment**, seeking to **worship, unleash, or harness** these forces.  
- **Insurgent Leakers** – Rogue agents and hackers dedicated to **exposing the truth**, despite knowing that knowledge alone can be lethal.  
- **Independent Hunters** – Former operatives, conspiracy theorists, and self-proclaimed investigators who **stumble into cases without government backing—or protection**.  

#### **Faction Rivalries & Conflicts:**  
- **The battle between secrecy and exposure**—should anomalies be contained or revealed to the public?  
- **The ethics of experimentation**—can anomalies be controlled, or is it reckless to try?  
- **The problem of rogue elements**—what happens when a former agent **leaks knowledge too dangerous to comprehend**?  

No one fully trusts anyone else. Sometimes, **your enemies are the ones funding your missions**—and the people you work for may not have your best interests in mind.  

---

### **Suppressed History & Forbidden Knowledge**  

The **real history** of paranormal investigation is **buried under layers of disinformation**, redacted documents, and erased testimonies.  

- **Ancient anomalies** have been covered up for centuries—entire **lost civilizations may have vanished due to phenomena humanity was never meant to encounter**.  
- **The Cold War Paranormal Arms Race** – Intelligence agencies across the world experimented with **psychic warfare, mind-control anomalies, and interdimensional research**, most of which ended in **classified disasters**.  
- **The Roswell Deception** – The public believes it was a hoax or a downed weather balloon. **Those who handled the original case know better.**  
- **MKUltra’s Unfinished Work** – Mind manipulation experiments weren’t **shut down**—they simply **went deeper underground** under new project names.  
- **The Timeline Anomalies** – Some classified reports suggest **evidence of human-made structures from thousands of years in the future**—implying **someone, somewhere, has already figured out time travel**.  

Some of this knowledge is **hidden for a reason**—it’s not just information, but an infection. **To read certain classified documents is to be permanently changed.**  

---

### **Anomalies, Entities & Unexplained Phenomena**  

Anomalies come in many forms, categorized based on **their properties, threat levels, and behavioral patterns**. Some follow patterns that can be **measured and understood**, while others **change when observed, alter human perception, or refuse to be contained by known laws of reality**.  

#### **Types of Anomalies:**  
- **Cognitohazards** – Information that **damages the mind just by being known**.  
- **Temporal Distortions** – Areas or artifacts that **loop, erase, or fragment time itself**.  
- **Possessed Objects** – Items that **display intelligence, hunger, or self-preservation instincts**.  
- **Biological Mutations** – Entities or organisms with **impossible anatomy, psychic abilities, or adaptation beyond evolution**.  
- **Extraterrestrial Contact** – Beings that **are not from our timeline, dimension, or known space**.  
- **Eldritch Constructs** – Impossible structures that **do not belong in three-dimensional space** and **react to human consciousness**.  

#### **Encounters & Outcomes:**  
- Some anomalies are **passive**, some are **aggressive**, and others are **actively rewriting reality around you**.  
- **Destroying an anomaly is not always possible**—sometimes, **the only way to stop it is to make sure no one remembers it exists**.  
- Some anomalies **learn from encounters**, making repeat investigations **more dangerous** each time.  

To work in this field is to **constantly redefine reality**—because reality, as you know it, **may already be compromised**.  

---

### **Cover-Ups, Misinformation & The Public**  

The most dangerous anomaly isn’t a monster—it’s **public knowledge**.  

- **Fake UFO reports, conspiracy theories, and disinformation campaigns** are **deliberate**—used to **bury real incidents under layers of fabricated nonsense**.  
- Witnesses are either **silenced, paid off, or discredited**, making them seem unreliable.  
- Some agencies don’t just **hide the truth**—they **replace it with something worse**.  
- **Whistleblowers disappear**, sometimes before they even go public.  
- Some **mass panic events** are staged—because nothing distracts the public from the **real threat** like a well-placed spectacle.  

Sometimes, **the only thing scarier than an anomaly is the organization cleaning up after it**.  

---

### **Experimental Technology & Paranormal Science**  

When the **laws of reality are challenged**, scientists and engineers **push back with classified research and prototype technology** designed to fight, contain, or exploit the unknown.  

#### **Examples of Experimental Equipment:**  
- **Anomaly Field Disruptors** – Devices meant to **shut down paranormal effects**—but may also cause them to **escalate**.  
- **Neural Firewall Implants** – Experimental brain modifications designed to **block out cognitohazards**, but they may **erase unintended memories**.  
- **Dimensional Anchors** – Portable devices used to **stabilize reality around areas of high distortion**—if activated too long, they might **trap the user outside normal timeflow**.  
- **Bio-Signal Augmenters** – Devices used to **track psychic signals**, but prolonged exposure may **alter the user’s perception of reality permanently**.  
- **Rewritten DNA Strains** – Engineered genes designed to **resist anomalous infections**—but test subjects report **increasingly non-human thoughts**.  

The deeper researchers go, the more **they become part of what they study**—and sometimes, they don’t come back **as themselves**.  

## Factions

### **The Black Sigil**  
- **Concept**: **Covert Occultists**  
- **Skills**: **Esoteric Knowledge, Ritual Containment**  
- **Frailty**: **Bound by Ancient Pacts**

The **Black Sigil** is a shadowy organization that blends **high-level intelligence operations with ancient ritual knowledge**. Formed by **rogue scientists, ex-occultists, and defectors from classified government programs**, they believe **paranormal forces should be controlled rather than destroyed or hidden**. They are known for **conducting dangerous experiments on anomalies**, seeking to **harness their power** for both personal and geopolitical gain.  

Their influence runs deep in **corporate research facilities and black-market artifact trading**, often clashing with agencies that prefer **containment over exploitation**. However, their greatest weakness lies in their **reliance on ancient pacts and rituals**, some of which have bound them to **forces beyond human understanding**.

Operating under the authority of **global shadow governments**, they dictate what is and isn’t known about **paranormal events, alien visitations, and interdimensional breaches**.  

Their influence extends into **military intelligence, misinformation campaigns, and psychological warfare**, ensuring that the general public remains unaware of **the true nature of reality**. However, their strict hierarchy and **uncompromising methods** have led to internal dissent, with some agents questioning whether **total suppression is sustainable** in the modern age.

Unlike factions that seek **secrecy or control**, they push for **gradual public exposure to anomalies**, believing that **suppressing the truth only delays the inevitable**.  

Operating in secret labs and **independent research facilities**, they develop **containment technologies, reality-stabilization devices, and experimental psychic defenses**. However, their **idealism makes them vulnerable**—they are **outmatched, underfunded, and constantly sabotaged by more powerful factions** who fear what would happen if the world learned too much, too quickly.

They believe anomalies are **not accidents, but messages**—blueprints for a **new order of existence**. Their core doctrine states that **exposure to anomalous forces will transform humanity into something greater**—or eradicate the weak.  

Their **influence creeps into corporations, universities, and high-ranking officials**, subtly pushing **policy changes and experimental projects that accelerate paranormal contact**. Their most radical members have **willingly undergone mutation or exposure to reality-warping artifacts**, believing they are **the harbingers of the new world to come**.  

Most factions see them as **unstable, dangerous, and irredeemable**—but **some believe they already know something the rest of the world is too afraid to acknowledge**.

- **Nemesis**: **The Sentinels of the Veil, who hunt them relentlessly.**  

The **Phantom Division** is a **decentralized collective** of **hackers, rogue AI constructs, and former intelligence operatives** who specialize in **breaking into classified data networks** related to paranormal activity. They operate in **hidden nodes across the dark web**, constantly moving and adapting to **stay ahead of containment agencies**.  

Their greatest asset is **their ability to manipulate reality through technology**—some of their members are **no longer entirely human**, existing partially as **digital consciousnesses**. They leak classified footage, expose falsified reports, and **weaponize information itself**.  

However, their decentralized nature means **internal conflict is frequent**, and their lack of a unified goal makes them **a constant target for infiltration and manipulation**. Some members want **disclosure**, others seek **power**, and a few have **gone so deep into the system that they no longer recognize what is real**.

- **Goal**: **To survive at any cost—and take control of their fate.**  
- **Motive**: **They believe they are no longer human, but something greater.**  
- **Nemesis**: **Any organization that sees them as a failed experiment.**  

The **Lazarus Accord** is composed of **operatives who should be dead**—agents exposed to anomalies that **rewrote their biology**, classified test subjects that **escaped government research labs**, and **soldiers who were "recovered" from lethal missions under circumstances they no longer fully understand**.  

They have no allegiance except to **each other**. No faction trusts them, as their **continued existence is an anomaly itself**. Some are **capable of regeneration, temporal displacement, or resisting psychic influence**—but all of them suffer from **identity fragmentation, memory loss, and an inability to confirm if they are still human at all**.  

They survive in **shattered safe houses, abandoned black sites, and forgotten labs**, seeking **answers about their own origins**. Some believe **they are a failed experiment that should be erased**—others **think they are the next stage of human evolution**.  

What they truly are is still uncertain.
