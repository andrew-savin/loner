# Pulp Adventures

***Pulp Adventures*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a vibrant, action-packed world inspired by early 20th-century pulp fiction. Dive into thrilling escapades across exotic locales, facing larger-than-life heroes, formidable villains, and supernatural perils.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be fast-paced, immersive, and easy to pick up, providing endless hours of adventurous storytelling.

## Introduction

*Pulp Adventures* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one resolving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Pulp Adventures** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Daring Explorer," "Mysterious Artifact," and "Cunning Villain."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG, a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series), a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are predetermined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Pulp Adventures* you will need:
- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Pulp Adventures* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind." But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

*Pulp Adventures* transports you to a world brimming with the thrill and mystery of classic pulp fiction. Imagine yourself exploring remote and unexplored regions like lost civilizations, uncharted islands, and hidden valleys. You’ll traverse exotic cities and metropolises such as Cairo, Shanghai, and New York City, uncovering secrets in ancient ruins and lost temples like Mayan pyramids and the legendary Atlantis.

In this world, larger-than-life heroes take center stage. These adventurous and daring protagonists range from fearless explorers and treasure hunters to cunning private eyes. They come from diverse backgrounds, each resourceful and strong-willed, with charismatic personalities that captivate and inspire.

The setting is rich with classic pulp archetypes. Two-fisted adventurers and treasure hunters embark on dangerous quests, while intrepid reporters and fearless journalists seek the truth. Daring pilots and dashing aviators soar through the skies, cunning private investigators and hard-boiled detectives unravel mysteries, and mysterious, alluring femme fatales weave their intricate webs.

Your adventures will be filled with high-stakes quests and globe-trotting exploits, fraught with deadly traps and treacherous environments. You’ll face dangerous criminals, secretive cults, and villainous organizations, engaging in perilous chases and daring escapes.

The supernatural and the occult add another layer of intrigue. Ancient curses and forbidden knowledge lurk in the shadows, and mystical artifacts and relics hold incredible power. You’ll encounter strange creatures and beings like mummies, vampires, and aliens, while secret societies and cults pursue sinister agendas.

Cutting-edge technology, at least for the time period, plays a crucial role. Advanced gadgets and inventions, such as ray guns and experimental aircraft, are at your disposal. Mad scientists create bizarre inventions, and futuristic vehicles and modes of transportation propel your adventures forward.

Antagonists in *Pulp Adventures* are as memorable as the heroes. Sinister criminal masterminds and megalomaniacs plot their schemes, corrupt officials and power-hungry tyrants abuse their power, deranged cultists and fanatical followers carry out dark rituals, and ruthless treasure hunters and rival adventurers compete for glory and riches.

Combat is gritty and action-packed, featuring high-octane fistfights and brawls, intense shootouts and gunfights, and daring stunts and death-defying feats. Each encounter is a thrilling test of your hero’s mettle.

Expect cliffhanger endings and serialized narratives that keep you on the edge of your seat. Episodic adventures with recurring characters and storylines create dramatic cliffhangers and unresolved plotlines, fostering ongoing mysteries and overarching conspiracies that unfold over time.

The aesthetics and tone of *Pulp Adventures* are distinctly retro and vintage. Bold colors and dynamic poses define the art style, while sensationalized language and dramatic narration capture the essence of pulp fiction. Throughout your journey, a sense of wonder, excitement, and high adventure permeates every scene, making each moment unforgettable.

## Aesthetics & Tone

By incorporating these advices, *Pulp Adventures* creates a rich, immersive experience that captures the spirit of classic pulp fiction. Each aspect of the aesthetics and tone works together to draw players into a world of vibrant colors, dynamic action, and thrilling storytelling.

You're absolutely right! For a solo RPG like *Pulp Adventures*, the focus should shift to how the *player* can create vivid, immersive scenes for themselves through descriptions, random prompts, and imaginative cues. Let's reframe the section with that in mind.

### Vivid Descriptions & Tone

In *Pulp Adventures*, you are the architect of your own vibrant and thrilling world. Without a GM, it's up to you to craft scenes that capture the bold, fast-paced action of the pulp genre. Use the following techniques to bring your solo game to life, enhancing the sensory experience and immersing yourself deeper into the narrative:

- **Dynamic Scene Building**: When transitioning between moments of action, ask yourself key descriptive questions. *What does the environment look like?* *What is the mood or atmosphere?* Describe settings with urgency, whether it's the heat of a desert chase or the eerie quiet of an ancient temple.
  
- **Sensory Prompts**: To fully immerse yourself, imagine how your character experiences the scene through all five senses:
  - *What do they hear?* The roar of a jet engine, the hiss of steam, or the whisper of an ancient curse?
  - *What do they see?* Dark shadows hiding danger, bright explosions lighting up the night, or forgotten treasures gleaming in the sun?
  - *What do they feel?* The cold bite of wind, the damp heat of a jungle, or the thrill of discovery?
  - *What do they smell or taste?* The acrid scent of gunpowder, the musty air of a hidden tomb, or the salty spray of the sea.

- **Sharp Contrasts in Scenes**: As you narrate your adventure, emphasize sharp contrasts to mimic the dramatic swings common in pulp fiction. Move between moments of tense, silent buildup to explosive action, or shift from light-hearted banter to life-threatening peril in an instant. 

- **Cliffhanger Decisions**: At the end of each scene, leave unresolved tension for yourself to return to. Let the outcome hang in the balance, forcing you to pick up the story in the next session with a renewed sense of excitement.

- **Action-Driven Language**: Use bold, dynamic language to describe your character’s actions. Think in terms of *big movements*—whether they are leaping across rooftops, diving behind cover, or grappling with a villain atop a speeding train.

- **Random Inspiration**: When stuck, consult a table or oracle system for spontaneous prompts. This keeps scenes unpredictable and introduces fresh twists, like sudden enemies, unexpected traps, or surprising allies.

### Dynamic and Action-Packed Scenes

In *Pulp Adventures*, the excitement lies in the relentless action that you, as the player, create. Whether your character is swinging from vines, locked in a fistfight, or racing through city streets, your solo experience is designed to feel like a continuous thrill ride. You are responsible for crafting high-energy moments that keep you engaged in the fast-paced world of pulp fiction.

- **Mid-Action Descriptions**: When narrating a scene, picture your character in the middle of daring feats—jumping from a train, diving to avoid gunfire, or leaping across rooftops. Imagine the movement and energy of these moments to keep the tension high.
- **Emphasizing Motion**: Always describe how your character moves, focusing on speed and agility. Are they sprinting through an alley, climbing a cliff, or dodging an incoming punch? Create momentum in every scene.
- **Adrenaline-Pumping Choices**: Frequently create moments where your character faces life-or-death decisions. Should they leap into the unknown, risk a high-speed chase, or go head-to-head with a villain? Keep the narrative thrilling and unpredictable.

### Sensational Language

The tone of *Pulp Adventures* is dramatic and larger-than-life. As you narrate your character’s story, lean into over-the-top dialogue and descriptions. The pulp genre thrives on exaggerated emotions and actions, and you’ll be the one bringing that tone to life as both player and narrator.

- **Exclamation Marks and Hyperbole**: Don’t hold back! When your character speaks or reacts to events, imagine it’s a pulp magazine cover: full of energy and impact! "I’ll never let you get away with this!" or "This is madness!" Feel free to use bold, punchy language.
- **Descriptive Flourishes**: When something explodes, describe the flames reaching the sky! When a villain makes a threat, narrate it as if the whole world depends on your response. Every event should feel like it has high stakes, even the small moments.

### Retro Futurism

The setting of *Pulp Adventures* blends the nostalgic charm of the 1930s-1950s with futuristic technology. This retro-futurism creates a world where zeppelins soar alongside experimental aircraft, and adventurers wield ray guns and pilot robotic companions. As the player, you’ll need to imagine and describe this mix of old-school charm with outlandish, advanced tech.

- **Period Details**: Imagine your character wearing a tailored 1930s trench coat while using a futuristic communicator. Describe the world’s architecture as a blend of art deco skyscrapers and science labs filled with glowing machines.
- **Tech Meets Style**: Picture your character using a combination of gadgets like wrist-mounted ray guns or anti-gravity boots in otherwise familiar settings—like bustling city streets or jungle ruins. The contrast adds excitement to the world you're building.
- **Blend of Old and New**: Whether your character is engaging in a dogfight in a biplane or sneaking aboard a sleek zeppelin, remember to blend classic pulp aesthetics with futuristic technology to keep the setting cohesive and fantastical.

### Mystery and Suspense

A key element of *Pulp Adventures* is the constant sense of mystery and suspense. You’ll keep yourself on the edge of your seat by weaving unresolved plotlines and thrilling cliffhangers throughout your story. When creating scenes, always leave something unsolved—whether it’s a mysterious artifact or a shadowy figure lurking in the background.

- **Cliffhanger Scenes**: At the end of each session, leave the story at a suspenseful moment. *Will the ancient temple collapse before the treasure is retrieved?* *Who is the masked villain following you through the marketplace?* Keep questions lingering to drive you forward.
- **Twists and Surprises**: Don’t be afraid to surprise yourself by consulting your game’s oracle or random tables for plot twists. Perhaps an ally betrays you, or a routine mission goes sideways. Constantly disrupt your own expectations to keep the tension high.
- **Suspenseful Atmosphere**: Whenever you describe a scene, add a layer of unease. Imagine the flickering lights of an old mansion, the deep silence before an ambush, or the distant howl of something unknown. Make your surroundings feel tense and full of hidden threats.

### Romanticized Adventure

In *Pulp Adventures*, your character is the ultimate hero—courageous, virtuous, and always ready for adventure. The story you tell should reflect that larger-than-life persona, with epic quests, dangerous romances, and heroic deeds that feel like they belong in the pages of a pulp novel.

- **Idealized Heroics**: Your character is more than just an adventurer—they're a symbol of bravery. When narrating their actions, lean into their larger-than-life qualities. They don't just fight villains, they do so with unwavering confidence and style. They face danger head-on, because they always believe in their cause.
- **Epic Quests**: The stakes should always feel monumental. Whether your character is trying to stop an ancient evil from awakening or racing against time to save a city, treat every mission as grand and world-changing. Describe the journey as expansive, taking your character across continents or through mysterious realms.
- **Romantic Elements**: Add emotional depth by intertwining romance and heroism. Whether your character is motivated by the love of an ally or is swept up in the allure of a mysterious stranger, let these emotional connections drive some of your decisions. Heroism in *Pulp Adventures* often includes passionate encounters and romantic gestures.

## Characters

In *Pulp Adventures*, characters are vibrant and dynamic, reflecting the larger-than-life nature of pulp fiction heroes and villains.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Pulp Adventures*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Pulp Adventures* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Pulp Adventures* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Pulp Adventures* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

## The World of *Pulp Adventures*

In this pulpy, thrill-laden Earth, every landmark brims with mysteries and intrigue. Here, international expeditions, clandestine societies, and supernatural phenomena transform familiar places into enigma-filled landscapes. The far corners of the world—from the Amazon to the Himalayas—call to adventurers, promising riches, danger, and secrets that push the limits of human understanding.

### The Lost Isle of Mu (Pacific Ocean)

**A Forgotten Empire Cloaked in Mist**

The Isle of Mu, a realm half-forgotten by time, lies cloaked in an eternal mist somewhere in the vast Pacific. Considered by most scholars to be pure myth, this fabled island whispers of a civilization whose reach predates Egypt and Mesopotamia. Among those few who claim to have seen Mu, tales emerge of massive ruins and treasure-filled halls, relics of an empire that wielded knowledge far beyond our own.

*In-World Knowledge*: Mu’s location is rumored to be marked only by fragments of ancient maps, rare artifacts, and the whispered legends of indigenous sailors. Those who know its lore hint at secrets that can twist the very fabric of reality.

- **Key Locations**:
  - **The Obsidian Pyramids**: Rising from the jungle in defiance of time, these black volcanic towers are unlike any other structures on Earth. Etched with symbols and star maps, they are said to hold the key to an astral alignment that could open gateways to other worlds.
  - **The Cave of Mirrors**: A labyrinth of glass-like walls that reflect not only one’s physical image but the desires, fears, and regrets buried deep within. Rumor has it that those who linger too long fall victim to an illusion so potent, they become lost to the real world.
  - **The Sunken Monastery**: Perched on the cliffs, half-claimed by the sea, this monastery appears abandoned, yet visitors report seeing robed figures. It is said that these monks hold scrolls describing humanity’s earliest origins, guarded for centuries from prying eyes.

- **Inhabitants**:
  - **The Mist-Walkers**: Dark shapes that drift silently through Mu’s jungles, the Mist-Walkers vanish at the slightest attempt at contact. They are believed to be guardians, bound to keep Mu’s secrets from leaving the island.
  - **Carnivorous Flora**: Unlike any flora cataloged by science, Mu’s plant life is aware and deadly, responding to human movement with intelligence. Vines twist and coil, and flowers secrete poison, making the island itself a trap for the unwary.

### The Amazon Basin (South America)

**The Heart of the Unconquerable Jungle**

The Amazon Basin, stretching green and dark, harbors wonders and horrors that have never been charted. Ancient civilizations vanished long before European explorers arrived, leaving behind ruins and symbols that scholars can only partially decipher. The jungle conceals secrets in layers of life and decay, luring in countless explorers, and swallowing most of them forever.

*In-World Knowledge*: Local legends and symbols carved into temple stones suggest an empire that worshiped nature with fervent devotion. Those few artifacts recovered hint at a culture that melded with the jungle so deeply that it may have left its legacy as sentient as it was spiritual.

- **Key Locations**:
  - **The Green Pyramid**: Deep within the jungle, a moss-covered pyramid rises above the trees. Locals say the *Heart of the Forest*, a sacred artifact capable of healing—or cursing—those who touch it, lies within. Though seldom seen, those who have returned speak of overwhelming power and a sense that the pyramid itself is alive.
  - **The Valley of Giants**: Towering statues line the cliffs, depicting giant, humanoid guardians, hands raised in warning. Legends speak of the Eternal Garden, a sanctuary at the valley’s heart, where time is said to stand still.
  - **The River of No Return**: This tributary appears on no map. Its waters, which shift unpredictably, are rumored to carry travelers to worlds beyond. Survivors speak of strange lights beneath the surface and hear voices echoing from the shadows.

- **Inhabitants**:
  - **The Serpent People**: A reclusive tribe rumored to communicate with the animals of the jungle, fiercely protecting its sacred sites from outsiders. Some believe they possess an ancestral link to the ancient jungle empire.
  - **Spectral Jaguars**: These ghostly predators stalk at night, their luminous eyes an omen of protection. Local belief holds that they guard holy places, and those who encounter them unprepared are rarely seen again.

### The Streets of Cairo (Egypt)

**Where Ancient Powers Stir Beneath the Sand**

Cairo, a city of endless intrigue, lies at the heart of ancient mysteries and modern schemes. Egyptologists and black-market treasure hunters crowd its dusty streets, hungry for a share of its forgotten treasures. From dusty marketplaces to secluded tombs, secrets run like veins beneath the city, and whispers of arcane practices never quite die.

*In-World Knowledge*: Known as the *City of Kings* by some, Cairo has long been the subject of occult fascination. It is said that the city lies atop portals and passageways dating back to an era when magic and gods roamed freely.

- **Key Districts**:
  - **The Bazaar of Secrets**: Nestled within Cairo’s bustling heart, this market’s most mysterious corners offer everything from relics that glow in the dark to maps of undiscovered tombs. Legends circulate about a hidden door within the Bazaar that leads to an unknown temple.
  - **The Crypt of Kings**: Located just outside Cairo’s borders, this crypt holds the remains of pharaohs whose curses are said to guard untold wealth. Explorers have documented passages leading from the crypt to ancient complexes across the city.
  - **The Obelisk of Ra’s Eye**: This towering monument, chipped but still imposing, is rumored to grant visions to those who meditate at its base during an eclipse. Some claim these visions can foretell distant events, yet few survive to confirm.

- **Notable Figures**:
  - **The Cult of Amun-Ra**: This secretive organization performs rituals meant to keep the gods close to the mortal realm. Whispers say they have summoned both spirits and, on rare occasions, gods to reclaim ancient artifacts.
  - **The Shade of Saqqara**: This ghostly apparition appears near the step pyramid of Saqqara. Most who encounter it describe an ancient figure, regal yet mournful, who seems determined to keep the secrets of the pyramid buried.
