---

## **Introduction**

*Savage Blades of Xylandra* follows these design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common six-sided dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one resolving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Savage Blades of Xylandra** throws you headfirst into the heart of planetary adventure. Your character will be defined by thematic tags such as *“Lost Starfarer”*, *“Sky-Pirate Duelist”*, *“Relic Seeker”*, or *“Feral Gladiator”*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### **Minimum Requirements**  
To play *Savage Blades of Xylandra*, you will need:  

- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors.  
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition.  
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.  
- **Notebook**: *Savage Blades of Xylandra* is not a solo journaling game; you can easily play it in the "theater of the mind." However, you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!  

## **Setting Introduction: Xylandra, The Lost Planet**  

Xylandra is a savage world of **ancient alien ruins, exotic civilizations, planetary warlords, airships, lost technologies, and primal conflict**.

## **Timeline of Xylandra**  

Xylandra’s **true history is fragmented**, hidden within ancient ruins, oral traditions, and forbidden archives. Different cultures **interpret events differently**, leading to **contradictory myths and competing truths**.  

### **The Known Eras**  

**??? – The Era of the Builders (Mythic Time)**  
- A **great and advanced civilization** ruled Xylandra.  
- They **constructed massive cities, created bioengineered life, and harnessed the planet’s energies**.  
- Something happened—**a war, a rebellion, a cosmic disaster**—that led to their **disappearance**.  
- Their **machines and temples still function**, though no one fully understands them.  

**Unknown – The Fracturing**  
- The sky **split**, and time itself **became unstable**.  
- **New species and civilizations** appeared, some from other worlds, others from **Xylandra’s own past and future**.  
- The planet became a **battleground**, with warring factions **trying to claim its ruins**.  

**Recent Past – The Warlord Age**  
- The **old empires collapsed**, and new powers **rose from the ashes**.  
- **Sky-pirates, raiders, and warlords** fought over the planet’s **few remaining stable territories**.  
- Some rediscovered **forgotten technologies**, while others turned to **brute force and conquest**.  

**Now – The Age of Uncertainty**

- Time itself is growing **even less stable**, causing **entire regions to vanish or return**.  
- Warlords, scholars, and mystics **seek the truth**—but some fear that **Xylandra’s true purpose** is still unfolding.  

## **Characters**  

In *Savage Blades of Xylandra*, you take on the role of **a warrior, a rogue, or an outcast** trying to carve your destiny on a savage and mysterious planet. Whether you are **a relic-hunting archaeologist**, **a blood-bound gladiator**, **a disgraced warlord**, or **a sky-pirate seeking fortune**, your path is yours to decide.  

Xylandra is a world where **cunning and strength matter more than lineage**, where **lost technologies blur the line between magic and science**, and where **survival depends on your ability to adapt to its shifting, unpredictable nature**.  

Characters in this game are **not defined by numbers or rigid mechanics**—instead, they are **described through evocative tags** that shape how they **fight, explore, negotiate, and uncover ancient secrets**.  

### Everything is a Character!

In *Savage Blades of Xylandra*, **Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even important objects like vehicles** are treated as **characters** with defining traits.  

A rusting **warship**, an **ancient sentient construct**, a **wandering swordsman**, or a **mutant warlord**—all can be defined using the same framework, ensuring **consistency and intuitive gameplay**.  

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Nomadic Blade-Dancer"* or *"Exiled Warlord"*.
- **Skills** (x2):Abilities that **set the character apart**. These are not basic attributes but **distinct competencies** like *"Beast-Speaker"*, *"Stormblade Master"*, *"Lore-Keeper of the Ancients"*, *"Skyship Duelist"*
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially, such as *"Haunted by a Lost Timeline"*, *"Oath-Bound to an Unworthy Lord"*, *"Marked by the Forbidden Tech"*, *"Hunted by an Ancient Curse"*
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait. Examples: *"Void-Tempered Scimitar"*, *"Sun-Steel Bracers"*, *"Fragment of a Fallen Star"*, *"Twin Plasma Javelins"*
- **Goal**: The long-term objective, like *"Unearth the Last City of the Builders"*, *"Break the Chains of the Blood-Warlords"*, *"Claim the Throne of the Sky-King"*, *"Discover the Truth of Xylandra’s Fractured Past"*
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal, like *"To Restore a Lost Legacy"*, *"To Overcome the Prophecy of Doom"*, *"To Reclaim a Stolen Honor"*, *"To Prove I Am More Than a Relic of the Past"*.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult.
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*[Title]* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *[Title]* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *[Title]* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### **Setting-Related Rules for Savage Blades of Xylandra**  

Xylandra is a world of **pulp adventure, ancient technologies, lost civilizations, and brutal combat**. The following rules add **genre-specific elements** to enhance the **Sword and Planet** experience, while still relying on the **oracular system** to resolve outcomes.  

---

## **Survival in the Harsh Lands**  
Xylandra is **an unforgiving world**, where adventurers must **navigate treacherous landscapes, survive brutal climates, and endure hardships unknown to most mortals**.  

### **Environmental Threats**  
When traveling through the **harsh landscapes of Xylandra**—such as **burning deserts, storm-wracked skies, or beast-infested ruins**—test survival by asking the **Oracle**:  

| Oracle Roll | Survival Outcome |
|------------|----------------|
| **Yes, and...** | You find safe passage and perhaps a hidden resource. Gain an advantage. |
| **Yes...** | You endure the trial and reach your destination. No lasting harm. |
| **Yes, but...** | You make it through, but at a cost—wounded, exhausted, or losing supplies. |
| **No, but...** | You fail, but salvage something—perhaps a secret path or unexpected aid. |
| **No...** | The journey takes a toll—you are weakened, lost, or badly injured. |
| **No, and...** | The world fights back! A deadly storm, a hostile beast, or a sandquake threatens your life. |

---

## **The Struggle for Ancient Relics**  
Forgotten ruins hide **weapons, artifacts, and lost technologies**—but such treasures do not give up their secrets easily.  

### **Recovering a Relic**  
When attempting to **activate, understand, or claim an ancient artifact**, test fate with the **Oracle**:  

| Oracle Roll | Relic Interaction Outcome |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | The relic functions beyond expectation—perhaps granting temporary insight or a hidden power. |
| **Yes...** | The artifact works, providing its intended benefit. |
| **Yes, but...** | The relic activates, but something goes wrong—partial power, unintended consequences, or attracting attention. |
| **No, but...** | The relic fails, but you learn something about its nature or history. |
| **No...** | The artifact resists your attempts—perhaps it requires a missing key, a ritual, or another sacrifice. |
| **No, and...** | The relic backfires! A trap triggers, a defense system activates, or an ancient intelligence awakens! |

---

## **Airship Combat and High-Speed Chases**  
Skyships, war-gliders, and **gravity-defying relics** make aerial combat **a chaotic dance of fire and steel**.  

### **Chasing a Skyship or Outmaneuvering an Enemy**  
When pursuing a **fleeing ship or evading pursuit**, test skill and luck with the **Oracle**:  

| Oracle Roll | Chase Outcome |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | You not only catch/escape, but gain an extra advantage—perhaps a shortcut or surprise maneuver. |
| **Yes...** | You succeed in the chase—closing the distance or losing your pursuers. |
| **Yes, but...** | You achieve your goal, but at a cost—damage to your ship, loss of fuel, or an unexpected twist. |
| **No, but...** | You fail to catch/escape, but discover a new option—perhaps a hidden path or an ally’s aid. |
| **No...** | The enemy gains ground—you are outmatched, outmaneuvered, or facing disaster. |
| **No, and...** | You lose control! A storm hits, an engine fails, or enemy forces close in! |

---

## **Warlords, Factions, and Power Struggles**  
On Xylandra, the strong rule by **force, guile, or sheer charisma**. A single **duel, betrayal, or alliance** can shift the balance of power.  

### **Negotiating with a Warlord or Faction Leader**  
When bargaining for **alliance, mercy, or favor**, let the **Oracle** decide your fate:  

| Oracle Roll | Political Outcome |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | The faction not only agrees but grants an unexpected boon! |
| **Yes...** | Your request is accepted—terms are set, and a deal is made. |
| **Yes, but...** | The deal is struck, but with a complication—a debt, condition, or hidden clause. |
| **No, but...** | The deal is rejected, but you learn something about the warlord’s ambitions. |
| **No...** | The faction refuses and may now see you as a threat or nuisance. |
| **No, and...** | You have insulted them, miscalculated, or walked into a trap! |

---

## **The Unstable Nature of Time and Reality**  
Xylandra exists **outside normal space-time**, causing **strange occurrences, lost memories, and paradoxical events**.  

### **Experiencing a Time or Reality Distortion**  
When passing through a **fractured zone** or interacting with **time-warped technology**, roll the **Oracle**:  

| Oracle Roll | Temporal Disturbance Effect |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | You glimpse a crucial moment—past or future—and act accordingly. |
| **Yes...** | You stabilize reality and endure the anomaly with minimal disruption. |
| **Yes, but...** | You remain intact, but something changes—a missing memory, a shift in history. |
| **No, but...** | You are thrown off-balance—time skips, the past changes slightly, or reality flickers. |
| **No...** | You are displaced—losing time, forgetting events, or emerging somewhere unexpected. |
| **No, and...** | Reality **shatters around you**—perhaps dropping you in a different era or attracting the attention of ancient forces! |

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## **Skyships of Xylandra**  

Xylandra is a world where **the skies are as treacherous as the land below**, and **skyships are the lifeline of explorers, warlords, and scavengers alike**. These vessels—powered by **arcane engines, solar winds, or forgotten Builder-tech**—sail across the vast **atmospheric currents**, navigating between floating ruins, storm-wracked cloud cities, and war-ravaged skyfronts.  

The **Sky-Yards** of Xylandra produce ships of **various sizes and purposes**, from **nimble raiding skiffs** to **monolithic floating fortresses**. Whether you command a **rugged scavenger barge, an elite sky-hunter’s warship, or a long-lost relic drifting through the void**, your ship is more than mere transport—it is **your home, your weapon, and your legend**.

Many seek **the lost wonders of the Builders, the hidden strongholds of forgotten warlords, or the ruins of cities erased from time**—but **only the boldest explorers, relic hunters, and warriors dare venture into the unknown**.  

---

### **Preparation for Exploration**

The **Bone-Kings** are the self-proclaimed **rulers of the wastelands**, bound by an **unshakable warrior code** that dictates only **the strongest can lead**. Their **fortress-cities rise from the corpses of conquered nations**, and their warbands **scour the sands for weapons, warriors, and relics** that will further their **ever-expanding dominion**.  

Loyalty to the Bone-Kings is **earned in battle**—to rise among their ranks, one must **challenge and slay their superior** in **a public duel of honor**.

Many Rift Scholars are **shunned by society**, seen as **reckless fools or dangerous heretics**. Some have **disappeared into the Riftlands**, emerging years later **as something else entirely**—or **never emerging at all**.

They take **no contracts they cannot complete**, and once **a deal is struck, it is absolute**—they have been known to **slaughter former allies** if the contract demands it.

They are feared as **specters, assassins, and living omens of disaster**. Many warlords **refuse to deal with them**, believing their presence to be **a sign of impending doom**.  

But the Ghosts do not seek power or war—they **seek answers**. They know that **Xylandra is unraveling**, and if no one stops it, **there will be nothing left to fight over**.  

## **Political Entities of Xylandra**  

Xylandra is a **fractured world**, where **power is fragmented across warring warlords, skybound freeholds, rogue scholars, and ancient cults**. There is **no unified empire**, only shifting alliances, ancient feuds, and **temporary truces between those who seek dominion over the planet's secrets**.  

While some factions seek **stability or trade**, others thrive in **chaos and war**, and **diplomatic relationships can shift in an instant**. A former ally can become an enemy **overnight**, and long-standing rivalries often **ignite into open conflict**.  

---

### **Major Political Entities of Xylandra**  

1. **The Bone-Kings of the Wastes** – Warlord conquerors who **rule through strength and honor**. They seek **absolute dominion** over Xylandra.  
2. **The Skyborne Freeholds** – A **loose coalition of skyship captains, rebels, and traders** who resist warlord control and favor independence.  
3. **The Rift Scholars** – Knowledge-seekers **obsessed with unraveling the mysteries of Xylandra’s anomalies**—even at great cost.  
4. **The Cult of the Builder-Gods** – Fanatics who **worship the lost civilization of the Builders** and hoard ancient relics as **sacred artifacts**.  
5. **The Ironfang Mercenary Guild** – Ruthless **warriors for hire**, who pledge **loyalty only to coin** and sell their services to the highest bidder.  
6. **The Ghosts of the Fracture** – Rift-touched **outcasts**, altered by **time distortions**, who seek **to prevent Xylandra’s final collapse**.  

---

## **Diplomatic Relationship Matrix**  

Below is the **current state of alliances, conflicts, and tensions** among Xylandra's factions. This **shifts over time**, and major events—like a warlord’s death, the discovery of a lost Builder city, or an anomaly surge—could **drastically alter these relationships**.  

| Faction → | Bone-Kings of the Wastes | Skyborne Freeholds | Rift Scholars | Cult of the Builder-Gods | Ironfang Mercenary Guild | Ghosts of the Fracture |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Bone-Kings of the Wastes** | —        | **Hostile** (Skyborn defy their rule) | **Tense** (Distrustful of their knowledge) | **Cold** (Superstition prevents outright war) | **Cordial** (Employ their services) | **Hostile** (See them as abominations) |
| **Skyborne Freeholds** | **Hostile** (Warlords threaten their freedom) | — | **Neutral** (Some value knowledge, others fear it) | **Tense** (The Cult opposes relic salvaging) | **Cold** (Many have suffered at their hands) | **Cordial** (Both are outcasts of society) |
| **Rift Scholars** | **Tense** (Seen as meddlers) | **Neutral** (Deal with them cautiously) | — | **Hostile** (The Cult sees them as heretics) | **Cold** (Have no use for mercenaries) | **Friendly** (Both seek to understand anomalies) |
| **Cult of the Builder-Gods** | **Cold** (Occasionally trade, but do not trust) | **Tense** (Despise their scavenging) | **Hostile** (View them as desecrators) | — | **Cordial** (Employ them to recover lost artifacts) | **Tense** (Regard them as cursed souls) |
| **Ironfang Mercenary Guild** | **Cordial** (Frequent war contracts) | **Cold** (Rarely hire them) | **Cold** (Only work for coin, not knowledge) | **Cordial** (Paid to protect holy sites) | — | **Hostile** (Their unpredictability makes them unreliable) |
| **Ghosts of the Fracture** | **Hostile** (Hunted by warlords) | **Cordial** (Occasionally trade) | **Friendly** (Share common interests) | **Tense** (Viewed as unnatural) | **Hostile** (Refuse to work with them) | — |

### **Understanding the Matrix**  
- **Hostile** – Open war or severe conflict. Fighting is common, and neither side will negotiate unless forced.  
- **Tense** – Strong **distrust**, but occasional cooperation when necessary. Could lead to conflict or an alliance under the right circumstances.  
- **Cold** – A general dislike, but not outright hostile. Likely competitors or factions with opposing ideologies.  
- **Neutral** – No major conflict or alliance. Often interact cautiously but without significant friction.  
- **Cordial** – Generally positive relations, **but not a full alliance**. They **trade, work together, or share some interests**.  
- **Friendly** – Strong cooperation but **not bound by formal treaties**. Likely to work together regularly.  
- **Allied** – An **official alliance**, willing to **go to war for each other** (none currently exist in Xylandra).

### **Shifting Alliances & Power Struggles**  

Xylandra’s **political landscape is ever-changing**—a single **event, war, or lost relic discovery** can **change everything**.  

### **Examples of Shifting Relations:**  
- If the **Bone-Kings** launch a **major invasion**, the **Skyborne Freeholds and Rift Scholars** might **become allies of convenience**.  
- If a **Builder relic is unearthed**, the **Cult of the Builder-Gods and Rift Scholars** may **clash over who controls it**.  
- If the **Ghosts of the Fracture uncover a truth about Xylandra’s collapse**, they may become **targets of warlords and cultists alike**.  

At any time, players can **consult the Oracle** to determine:  
- **Has a faction’s stance changed?**  
- **Has an uneasy truce been broken?**  
- **Has a shocking betrayal occurred?**  

This **unpredictable political climate** ensures that **no alliance is permanent, and no enemy is forever**.
