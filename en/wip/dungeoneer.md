# Loner: Dungeoneer

***Loner: Dungeoneer*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in ancient, forgotten dungeons filled with peril and untold riches.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be a system-light, exploration-focused experience that emphasizes tactical navigation, resource management, and emergent storytelling driven by oracles.

## Introduction

*Loner: Dungeoneer* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Dungeoneer** throws you headfirst into the depths of forgotten dungeons. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *“Expert Trapspringer”* or *“Relentless Scout.”*

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Dungeoneer* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Dungeoneer* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Characters

[Brief introductory text flavored with the setting genre]

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Dungeoneer* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

### Character Traits

You can use these traits to create a character on the fly, mix them, or just use them as inspiration.

### Risk and Reward

In *Loner: Dungeoneer*, progression emerges organically through discovery, exploration, and overcoming challenges. Advancement rewards the Protagonist for skillful navigation, resourceful survival, and uncovering dungeon secrets—not just combat. Treasure, skills, and abilities enhance the story, offering powerful boons but always at a cost.

#### 1. Advancement Through Discovery

Advancement focuses on **qualitative progression** rather than abstract numerical levels. Characters grow through their experiences and the narrative they build.

##### **How Advancement Works**  
After a significant discovery, achievement, or expedition, you may:  
1. Add a **new tag** to your character (Skill, Gear, or Frailty).  
2. Modify an existing tag to reflect improvement or new context.  

**Triggering Advancement**:  
Ask the Oracle after notable events or achievements:  
- Discovering a hidden dungeon level or ancient chamber.  
- Solving a major puzzle or disarming a deadly trap.  
- Successfully navigating through extreme environmental hazards.  
- Recovering significant treasure or artifacts.  

**Examples**:  
- *“Trap Disarmer”* evolves into *“Master Mechanist.”*  
- Gain *“Runebound Compass”* after deciphering ancient maps.  
- Add *“Lingering Fear”* after surviving a terrifying ambush.

#### 2. Tag-Based Narrative Progression

Progression in *Loner: Dungeoneer* builds through the Protagonist's evolving **tags**. The more tags a character gains, the more complex and tailored they become to the dungeon's unique challenges.

- **New Tags**: Rewarded after key milestones to reflect growth. Examples include:  
   - **Skills**: *“Silent Step,”* *“Trap Whisperer,”* *“Vault Breaker.”*  
   - **Gear**: *“Enchanted Lantern,”* *“Rune-Marked Blade,”* *“Beast Traps.”*  
   - **Frailties**: *“Haunted Dreams,”* *“Weak Grip,”* *“Paranoid Mind.”*  

- **Modified Tags**: Update existing tags to reflect experience.  
   - *“Torch Handler”* evolves to *“Efficient Lightbearer”*.  
   - *“Stone Reader”* becomes *“Runestone Decipherer.”*  

Tags drive the emergent narrative and tie character progression to the challenges overcome and stories created.

#### 3. Skills and Abilities for Dungeon Exploration

Skills are not fixed traits; they emerge naturally as part of gameplay. The Protagonist gains or improves Skills tailored to dungeon delving.  

**Sample Exploration Skills**:  
| **Skill Tag**       | **Effect**                                       |  
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |  
| **Silent Step**      | Avoids detection in dangerous areas.            |  
| **Stone Reader**     | Deciphers hidden markings or architectural clues.|  
| **Trap Disarmer**    | Adds Advantage when disarming traps.            |  
| **Rope Expert**      | Ensures safe climbing and crossing.             |  
| **Map Forger**       | Creates detailed maps, preventing navigation loss.|  
| **Lorekeeper**       | Deciphers inscriptions, lore, and dungeon history.|  

## Rules

*Loner: Dungeoneer* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Dungeoneer* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Dungeoneer* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

### Preparation

* **Define Your Destination:**  Choose a specific location on your map (hand-drawn or provided) or have the Oracle (dice rolls) determine a general direction and a rumor about a point of interest.
* **Choose Your Mode of Travel:** Consider your character's skills, resources, and the desired speed of travel.
* **Stock Up:**  Gather supplies based on your chosen travel time and potential hazards. 

## Exploration

Exploration in *Loner: Dungeoneer* is the heart of the game. Dungeons are procedurally generated, filled with hazards, rewards, and opportunities for emergent narrative. Careful navigation, resource management, and endurance are key to surviving and thriving in these depths.

### **1. Mapping and Navigation**

- **Mapping the Dungeon**: As you explore, sketch your map as a grid-based layout or flowchart. Each new room, corridor, or landmark can be generated using a combination of **Oracle rolls** and tags. Use a single **Navigation Check** to determine how successfully you map and orient yourself:
  
**Navigation Check**  
Ask the Oracle as usual, then consult the following answer:

- **Yes**: You map the area accurately and find a key feature.  
- **No**: You lose track of your bearings or miss something crucial (roll for a complication).  
- **Yes, but...**: You map successfully, but at a cost (e.g., fatigue, spent supplies).  
- **No, but...**: You don’t map accurately, but you stumble upon something unexpected (e.g., a hidden passage, clue, or shortcut).  
- **Yes, and...**: You map perfectly and discover a major boon (e.g., a hidden treasure, a clear shortcut, or a safe resting place).  
- **No, and...**: You get hopelessly lost, wasting valuable time and resources, and trigger a hazard (e.g., a trap, enemy encounter, or environmental danger).  

- **Tagging Rooms**: Each room or corridor is assigned a descriptive **tag** using the Oracle or a random table. Examples include:  
  *“Collapsed Ceiling,”* *“Blood-Stained Statues,”* *“Echoing Chamber,”* or *“Ancient Rune Circle.”*  
  Tags inform further rolls or environmental interactions.

### **2. Light and Supplies Management**

In the dark dungeons, light is life. Supplies determine how long you can stay underground before being forced to retreat. Track these as **tags** that can be consumed or depleted.

#### **Light Sources**  

Each light source is a **Gear tag** and has a finite duration. Examples:  
- **Torch**: Burns for 1 Scene.  
- **Lantern**: Burns for 2 Scenes but uses oil.  
- **Glowstone**: Permanent but weak light (reduces visibility).  

**Light Mechanics**: At the start of each Scene, check your light source. If a light expires, mark it off and roll to determine if you encounter something unexpected in the darkness.  

#### **Supplies and Inventory**

Your supplies include rations, rope, tools, and other consumables. Each piece of consumable Gear is a tag (e.g., *“Rope Bundle,”* *“Rations,”* *“Oil Flask”*).  

- **Ration Check**: After every 3 Scenes or whenever Fatigue sets in, consume 1 Ration tag.  
- **Inventory Limits**: Carrying capacity is limited to 6 Gear tags. Excess gear causes **Encumbrance** (disadvantage on rolls involving physical actions).  

### **3. Exploration Fatigue and Stress**

Extended delves into dungeons push explorers to their limits. Fatigue and stress reflect the toll of danger, darkness, and physical effort.

#### **Fatigue System**

Whenever the following events occur, roll 1d6. On a 1-3, mark a **Fatigue Tag**:  
- After 6 Scenes without rest.  
- When failing a Navigation or Survival check.  
- After strenuous physical activity (climbing, running, etc.).  

**Fatigue Tags**: *“Weary,”* *“Sore Muscles,”* *“Mind Numbed,”* or *“Parched.”*  

- Each Fatigue tag imposes disadvantage on a related action.  
- **Resting** removes 1 Fatigue tag but consumes 1 Ration and requires a quiet, safe place.  

#### **Stress and Mental Strain**

Stress accumulates during tense or traumatic moments (traps sprung, enemies revealed, supplies lost).  
- After a failed Conflict, add a **Stress Tag** like *“Frayed Nerves”* or *“Shaken Resolve.”*  
- Stress impacts decision-making. Each Stress Tag reduces Luck by 1 (temporarily).  

**Resting to Recover**: Safe rest clears 1 Stress Tag.  

### **4. Scene-Based Exploration Flow**

Here’s how exploration works in structured Scenes:  

1. **Enter a New Area**: Roll for the room's tags and features using random tables or the Oracle.  
2. **Navigation Check**: Roll to determine mapping success and encounters.  
3. **Light Check**: Track light sources and roll for darkness complications if necessary.  
4. **Resource Check**: Consume rations and track gear used.  
5. **Fatigue and Stress**: Roll for possible consequences of extended exploration.  
6. **Interact with the Environment**: Use tags to explore clues, traps, treasure, or events.

### **5. Complications Table**

When navigation or light checks fail, roll for a complication:  

| D6  | Complication                    |
| ----| --------------------------------|
| 1   | Trap activates (roll for type). |
| 2   | Ambush! An enemy lurks nearby.  |
| 3   | Path blocked (rubble or chasm). |
| 4   | Supplies lost or damaged.       |
| 5   | You hear ominous sounds ahead.  |
| 6   | Environmental hazard (flood, gas). |

## **Dungeon Generator**

The Dungeon Generator is the toolset you use to create the ever-shifting, unpredictable labyrinths of *Loner: Dungeoneer*. It combines random rolls, tags, and oracle results to generate rooms, corridors, and encounters, ensuring no two expeditions are the same.

### **1. Room and Corridor Generation**

To generate a dungeon room or corridor, follow these steps:  

#### **A. Room Type**  
Roll 2d6 to determine the general type of room or corridor.

| 2D6 | Room Type                |
| ----| ------------------------ |
| 2   | Small chamber with debris. |
| 3   | Long corridor, cracked walls. |
| 4   | Grand hall with high ceilings. |
| 5   | Narrow hallway with alcoves. |
| 6   | Empty room, dust-filled. |
| 7   | Functional room (e.g., forge, library, vault). |
| 8   | Trapped room (mechanism, gas, pitfall). |
| 9   | Large chamber with columns/statues. |
| 10  | Natural cave or underground pool. |
| 11  | Shrine or ritual space. |
| 12  | Boss chamber or special location. |

#### **B. Room Features**  
Each room contains **tags** that describe its features. Roll 2d6 on the following table or consult the Oracle for inspiration.

| 2D6 | Feature Tag             |
| ----| ----------------------- |
| 2   | Bloodstains on the floor. |
| 3   | Broken statues or murals. |
| 4   | Hidden alcove with a faint glow. |
| 5   | Ceiling cracks, rubble below. |
| 6   | Ancient runes etched on the walls. |
| 7   | Dust-covered furniture or crates. |
| 8   | Strange sounds echo faintly. |
| 9   | Pools of water (or unknown liquid). |
| 10  | Stale, suffocating air. |
| 11  | A door barred or locked shut. |
| 12  | Evidence of recent activity (footprints, ash). |

Combine **Room Type** and **Feature Tags** to describe the space. Example: *"A Grand Hall (6) with Broken Statues (3) scattered across its floor."*

#### **C. Exits and Connections**  
Determine how many exits lead from the room:  
- Roll 1d6:  
  - **1-2**: 1 exit (dead end or single passage).  
  - **3-4**: 2 exits (split paths).  
  - **5-6**: 3 exits (multiple routes).  

**Corridors** may loop back, connect to previous rooms, or lead to new ones. If unsure, ask the Oracle:  
- *"Does this corridor connect back to the mapped dungeon?"*  

### **2. Dynamic Encounter Tables**

Dynamic encounter tables ensure variety in what you face as you explore. Encounters include monsters, traps, and environmental events, influenced by the dungeon's **conditions** (tags).

#### **A. Encounter Frequency**  
Roll for an encounter whenever:  
1. You enter a new room.  
2. The Oracle answers "No, and..." on navigation rolls.  
3. Light expires in a dangerous room.

**Encounter Check**  
Roll 1d6:  
- **1-2**: No encounter.  
- **3-6**: Roll for encounter.  

#### **B. Encounter Type**  
Roll 2d6 to determine what you face:

| 2D6 | Encounter Type                                      |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 2   | Environmental hazard (e.g., cave-in, flooding).     |
| 3   | Minor trap (pressure plate, dart).                  |
| 4   | Small creature (rats, insects).                     |
| 5   | Ambush (stealthy foe).                              |
| 6   | Hidden treasure (valuable but risky).               |
| 7   | Neutral presence (e.g., another adventurer, ghost). |
| 8   | Puzzle or locked mechanism.                         |
| 9   | Hostile monster (moderate strength).                |
| 10  | Major trap (collapsing floor, gas).                 |
| 11  | Monster lair (significant danger).                  |
| 12  | Dungeon Boss (strongest threat).                    |

### **3. Populating Rooms with Monsters, Traps, and Treasure**

When you roll an encounter, follow these mechanics to populate the room:

#### **A. Monsters**  
Monsters are defined by simple **tags**. Use the Oracle to generate traits, abilities, and weaknesses. Examples:  
- **Concepts**: *"Shadow Lurker,"* *"Stone Golem,"* *"Ravenous Swarm."*  
- **Skills**: *"Ambusher,"* *"Heavy Strikes,"* *"Unrelenting."*  
- **Frailties**: *"Light Sensitive,"* *"Slow,"* *"Weak to Fire."*  

#### **B. Traps**  
Traps are deadly challenges in rooms or corridors. Generate traps using tags:  
- **Trigger**: *"Pressure Plate,"* *"Magic Sigil,"* *"Hidden Lever."*  
- **Effect**: *"Falling Spikes,"* *"Poison Dart,"* *"Gas Cloud."*  

#### **C. Treasure**  
Treasure rewards are tagged items or valuable objects:  
- **Minor Treasure**: *"Jeweled Trinket,"* *"Ancient Coins,"* *"Runed Dagger."*  
- **Major Treasure**: *"Cursed Relic,"* *"Enchanted Weapon,"* *"Map Fragment."*  

**Treasure Check**: Roll 2d6 to determine treasure value:  
- **2-5**: Minor Treasure.  
- **6-9**: Useful Gear or gold.  
- **10-12**: Major Treasure (rare and valuable, may have risks).

### **4. Environmental Conditions**

The dungeon changes dynamically as you explore. Assign **Environmental Tags** to influence rooms, encounters, and narrative tension.

| Condition Tag          | Effect on Exploration             |
| -----------------------| --------------------------------- |
| *"Flooded Tunnels"*    | Movement is slow; Fatigue rolls more likely. |
| *"Shifting Walls"*     | Navigation rolls are harder.      |
| *"Darkness Falls"*     | Light burns faster; traps are harder to spot. |
| *"Crumbling Structure"*| Risk of cave-ins in each room.    |
| *"Frozen Air"*         | Increases Fatigue and Stress.     |
| *"Whispering Shadows"* | Monsters are stealthier; stress builds faster. |


## Environmental Interaction

The dungeon itself is more than just a backdrop—it’s a living, breathing challenge filled with mysteries, traps, and architectural secrets waiting to be uncovered. *Loner: Dungeoneer* provides tools for engaging with these environmental elements to reward exploration, creative thinking, and skillful problem-solving.

### Interacting with the Environment

Every room, corridor, or cavern has environmental tags that describe its unique features. Players can interact with these tags to uncover secrets, overcome obstacles, or trigger unforeseen dangers.  

**Steps to Interact**:  
1. Identify the **tag** of interest (e.g., *“Rune-Carved Wall,”* *“Loose Stones,”* *“Suspicious Floor Panel”*).  
2. Ask the Oracle a **closed question**: *“Do I uncover anything useful?”*  
3. Interpret the Oracle’s result, applying additional rules when necessary.

**Oracle Interpretations**:  
- **Yes**: You interact successfully and gain a useful outcome (e.g., uncover a clue, trigger a mechanism, or reveal treasure).  
- **Yes, but...**: You succeed, but a minor complication arises (e.g., fatigue, noise, or light consumption).  
- **No**: You fail to interact meaningfully or understand the feature.  
- **No, but...**: You fail, but gain a hint or partial insight.  
- **Yes, and...**: You succeed spectacularly and uncover a hidden boon (e.g., a shortcut, treasure, or secret path).  
- **No, and...**: You trigger a negative outcome (e.g., trap activation, monster awakening, or structural damage).

### Deciphering Ancient Inscriptions

Dungeon walls and artifacts often contain **ancient inscriptions** that hint at hidden dangers, treasure, or the dungeon’s lore.

**Steps to Decipher Inscriptions**:  
1. Use a skill-related tag (e.g., *“Lorekeeper,”* *“Rune Reader”*) to justify an attempt.  
2. Ask the Oracle: *“Can I decipher the inscription?”*  
3. Interpret the result:  

| **Result**         | **Outcome**                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yes**            | You decipher the message fully; it provides a clear clue or safe route.    |
| **Yes, but...**    | You understand most of the message, but there’s a misleading or vague part. |
| **No**             | The message remains indecipherable for now.                                |
| **No, but...**     | You can decipher a fragment or keyword that gives a vague hint.            |
| **Yes, and...**    | You fully decipher the message and uncover a hidden bonus (e.g., treasure).|
| **No, and...**     | The message is incomprehensible, and you trigger a complication (trap/curse).|

### Detecting and Disarming Traps

Traps are common hazards in dungeons and require both caution and skill to overcome. They come with **Trigger Tags** and **Effect Tags** that describe how they work.

#### **Step 1: Detect the Trap**  
- **Clues**: Environmental tags like *“Loose Tiles,”* *“Pressure Plate,”* or *“Narrow Slit in Wall”* often hint at traps.  
- **Detection Check**: Ask the Oracle, *“Do I detect a trap here?”*  
  - **Yes**: You detect the trap and its trigger.  
  - **No**: The trap remains hidden. Roll for consequences if you interact unknowingly.

#### **Step 2: Disarm the Trap**  
Once a trap is detected, you may attempt to disarm it using appropriate tags like *“Trap Disarmer”*, *“Steady Hands”*, or gear like *“Lockpicks”*.  

**Disarm Check**: Ask the Oracle, *“Can I disarm the trap safely?”*  
- **Yes**: The trap is disarmed with no issue.  
- **Yes, but...**: The trap is disarmed, but part of it activates (e.g., a small noise, minor damage).  
- **No**: You fail to disarm the trap, but it remains intact.  
- **No, but...**: You fail to disarm it, but you manage to partially neutralize its danger.  
- **Yes, and...**: The trap is disarmed perfectly, and you discover something useful (e.g., spare parts, clues).  
- **No, and...**: The trap triggers catastrophically (roll for the full trap effect).  

### Understanding Architectural Clues and Hidden Passages

The dungeon architecture often hides secrets: concealed doors, false walls, or passages leading to treasure or escape routes.

#### **Step 1: Spot the Clue**  
Look for architectural tags like:  
- *“Cracked Wall,”* *“Mismatched Stones,”* *“Dust-Free Floorboards,”* or *“Draught of Air.”*  

**Ask the Oracle**: *“Do I spot a clue to a hidden passage?”*  
- **Yes**: You find a clear clue that reveals the passage.  
- **Yes, but...**: You spot the passage, but it takes effort to open or triggers a minor hazard.  
- **No**: You find nothing suspicious.  
- **No, but...**: You uncover something else instead (e.g., treasure, inscription).  
- **Yes, and...**: You spot the passage and uncover a shortcut, treasure, or safe route.  
- **No, and...**: You miss the passage and trigger an unrelated danger (e.g., a collapsing section).  

### Environmental Hazards

Dungeons are unpredictable places. Environmental hazards can arise from unstable architecture, water, gas, or magical anomalies.

**Hazard Types**:  
- **Falling Debris**: Roll to dodge; failure causes harm or traps the player.  
- **Flooding**: Forces movement restrictions; gear and supplies may be damaged.  
- **Poisonous Gas**: Requires immediate action (e.g., leaving the room, blocking airflow).  
- **Unstable Structures**: Any major action could trigger collapse (roll the Oracle for safety).  
- **Arcane Anomalies**: Magical zones cause unpredictable effects (*“Gravity Shift,”* *“Illusory Walls,”* *“Maddening Whispers”*).  

**Handling Hazards**: Use tags, tools, and the Oracle to determine outcomes. Players can ask:  
- *“Can I escape the hazard in time?”*  
- *“Do I find a safe route around this hazard?”*

### Combining Environmental Elements

Rooms often combine multiple interactive elements (traps, inscriptions, hidden passages) to create layered challenges. Use the following process for dynamic interactions:

1. **Identify Tags**: Roll or assign tags for the environment (*“Cracked Wall,”* *“Rune Inscription,”* *“Loose Tiles”*).  
2. **Oracle Questions**: Use targeted Oracle questions to uncover secrets and consequences.  
3. **Dynamic Outcomes**: String results together narratively. For example:  
   - *"You find a Cracked Wall with strange Runes etched on its surface. Do I decipher the runes?"*  
   - If successful, *"The runes reveal a hidden lever. Can I open the passage safely?"*  
   - Build tension with mixed Oracle answers like *“Yes, but…”* (e.g., the passage opens, but it triggers a trap).  


## Resource Management

In *Loner: Dungeoneer*, survival depends on careful resource management. Your character's inventory is finite, tools wear out, and supplies dwindle as you delve deeper into the dungeon. Every decision — what to carry, when to use gear, and when to conserve—affects your success or failure.

### Inventory System: Carrying Capacity

Your Protagonist can only carry a limited amount of gear, emphasizing hard choices about what is essential for survival. Gear is represented by **tags**, each taking up a **slot** in your inventory.

#### Inventory Limits  
- Your Protagonist can carry up to **6 Gear Tags** at a time.  
- Optional: Add **+2 slots** for a **Backpack** tag or similar equipment.  

**Examples of Gear Tags**:  
- *“Torch,”* *“Rope Bundle,”* *“Rations,”* *“Lockpicks,”* *“Healing Herbs,”* *“Oil Flask.”*

#### Encumbrance  
If your inventory exceeds its limit, you become **Encumbered**:  

  - Add **Disadvantage** to all physical rolls (e.g., climbing, dodging).  
  - You must drop or use an item to regain normal movement.

### Equipment Durability

Tools and gear can wear out or break over time, particularly in hazardous environments. Durability tracks how long an item remains functional before it is unusable.

#### **Durability System**  
Each item has a **Durability Rating** represented as a series of marks (e.g., ⚙️⚙️⚙️ for 3 durability).  

When using an item in risky situations or repeatedly, roll 1d6:  
  - **1-2**: The item’s durability decreases by 1.  
  - **3-6**: The item remains intact.  

**Example Gear Durability Ratings**:  
| Item              | Durability |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Torch             | ⚙️ (1 use) |
| Rope Bundle       | ⚙️⚙️⚙️ (3 uses) |
| Lantern           | ⚙️⚙️ (2 uses, per oil flask) |
| Healing Herbs     | ⚙️ (1 use) |
| Lockpicks         | ⚙️⚙️ (2 uses) |

**Broken Gear**: If an item runs out of durability, it becomes **Broken** and cannot be used unless repaired.  

Repairs require appropriate tools, resources, or a safe location (ask the Oracle: *"Can I repair this item here?"*).

### Managing Limited Resources

Light, food, and healing supplies are critical for dungeon survival. These resources deplete as you explore, and running out can trigger consequences like **Fatigue**, **Stress**, or hazards.

#### A. Light Sources

Light is essential for navigating dungeons and spotting traps, enemies, or clues. Without light, you risk falling into darkness.

**Light Sources**:  
| Light Source     | Duration (Scenes) | Notes                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Torch            | 1                 | Simple, short-lived light.     |
| Lantern (Oil)    | 2                 | Bright but consumes oil.       |
| Glowstone        | Permanent         | Weak, reduces visibility.      |

**Using Light**:  
1. At the start of each **Scene**, mark off the current light source's duration.  
2. If the light expires, immediately ask the Oracle:  
   *"Do I encounter danger in the darkness?"*  
   - **Yes**: A hazard (trap, enemy, or environmental peril) occurs.  
   - **No**: You stumble but avoid disaster.  
3. Without light, all rolls involving **sight** have **Disadvantage**.

**Extinguishing Light**: You may extinguish a light source early to conserve it.

#### B. Rations and Food

Rations represent food and water required to stave off **Fatigue** during exploration.

**Ration Use**:  
- After every **3 Scenes** or during rest, consume 1 **Ration Tag**.  
- Running out of rations causes **Hunger**:  
  - Add **Disadvantage** to all rolls until food is found or provided.  
  - After 6 Scenes without food, gain **Fatigue Tags** like *“Weakened”* or *“Starving.”*  

#### C. Healing Supplies

Healing supplies allow you to recover from injuries, Stress, or Fatigue. These resources are finite and often consumed during rest or recovery scenes.

**Healing Items**:  
| Item              | Effect                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Healing Herbs     | Removes 1 **Fatigue Tag**.      |
| Bandages          | Restores **1 Luck Point**.      |
| Potions           | Fully heals minor injuries.     |

**Using Healing**:  
- During a **Quiet Scene** or Rest, consume a **Healing Tag** to recover.  
- Healing is player-facing—describe how you use the resource to justify its effect.

### Resource Pressure and Emergencies

The dungeon environment is hostile, and managing dwindling supplies creates natural tension. Use the following events to create resource pressure:  

1. **Unexpected Events**: Oracle answers like *"No, and..."* may trigger supply loss. Example: *“Your lantern falls and breaks!”*  
2. **Environmental Challenges**: Floods, traps, or monsters may consume gear (e.g., burning torches, ripping ropes).  
3. **Complications**: Failed skill rolls or navigation attempts may result in resource depletion.  
4. **Rest Costs**: Every time you rest to remove Stress or Fatigue, consume **1 Ration** and reduce **light duration** by 1 Scene.  

**Oracle Prompt**: *“Do I find supplies or spare gear here?”*  
- If successful, roll on a small table to determine what you find.  

### Tracking Resources: Quick Reference

Use a **Resource Tracker** to monitor inventory, durability, and consumables. Example:  

| **Gear**            | **Durability**   | **Notes**                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Rope Bundle         | ⚙️⚙️⚙️ (3)       | Used for climbing/traps.  |
| Torch               | ⚙️ (1)           | Light for 1 Scene.        |
| Healing Herbs       | ⚙️ (1)           | Removes 1 Fatigue.        |
| Rations             | ⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️ (4)     | 1 Ration per 3 Scenes.    |
| Lockpicks           | ⚙️⚙️ (2)         | Opens locked doors/chests.|
| Lantern (Oil Flask) | ⚙️⚙️ (2)         | 2 Scenes of bright light. |
