# Steel & Sorcery

***Steel & Sorcery*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a dark, gritty world where ancient ruins, corrupt cities, and wild frontiers are the backdrop for tales of survival, revenge, and treasure-hunting. The setting is steeped in mythological inspiration, drawing from pseudo-medieval and ancient cultures, where magic is rare, dangerous, and often feared.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be fast-paced, focusing on intense action, personal stakes, and morally ambiguous heroes who navigate a world of danger and mystery.

## Introduction

*Steel & Sorcery* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Steel & Sorcery** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *"Wary Adventurer"*, *"Cursed Blade"*, or *"Scarred Veteran"*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Steel & Sorcery* you will need:
- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Steel & Sorcery* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind." But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

*Steel & Sorcery* immerses you in a world where the past weighs heavily, and every shadow might hide a deadly threat. The setting is a blend of ancient ruins, dense forests, and desolate wastelands, where once-great civilizations have crumbled into obscurity, leaving behind cursed artifacts and forgotten lore.

The world is a dangerous place, ruled by tyrants, haunted by ancient evils, and stalked by vicious beasts. Magic exists, but it is the domain of dark sorcerers, corrupt priests, and other nefarious beings. Most common folk view it with suspicion or outright fear, and those who wield it are often met with hostility.

### Playable Themes

- **Survival**: Every day is a struggle against the harsh environment, dangerous beasts, and treacherous enemies.
- **Revenge**: A personal vendetta drives the hero, with enemies lurking at every corner.
- **Treasure Hunting**: Delve into forgotten ruins and ancient tombs in search of wealth and powerful artifacts.
- **Morality**: Navigate a world where right and wrong are blurred, and choices often have dire consequences.
- **Exploration**: Discover hidden places and ancient secrets, revealing the dark history of the world.

### Timeline

- **The Age of Heroes**: A time long past when great warriors and kings ruled the land, now remembered only in myths and legends.
- **The Fall of Empires**: Civilizations rose and fell, leaving behind ruins and relics of their former glory.
- **The Dark Age**: The present era, a time of decay, corruption, and fear, where only the strong survive.

## Characters

*Steel & Sorcery* is centered around the exploits of lone heroes or anti-heroes—warriors, rogues, and survivors—each with their own motivations, skills, and weaknesses. These characters are often morally ambiguous, driven by personal codes of honor, revenge, or simple survival.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Steel & Sorcery*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Cunning Mercenary"* or *"Haunted Gladiator"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Stealthy"* is not a skill, *"Shadow Stalker"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult.
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Steel & Sorcery* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Steel & Sorcery* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Steel & Sorcery* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **Twist Counter**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tags cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Sorcery

Sorcery in *Steel & Sorcery* is a perilous yet alluring path. The Six Circles of Sorcery represent escalating levels of power and risk, with each spell exacting a toll on the caster. Wielding magic demands both skill and resolve, as the temptations of Black Sorcery may lead to corruption and ruin.

### The Six Circles of Sorcery
1. **Ordered Power**: Sorcery is divided into six Circles, each representing a tier of magical potency.
2. **Luck as a Resource**: Casting a spell depletes **Luck**, with the Circle level determining the Luck cost (e.g., a spell from the Third Circle costs 3 Luck).
3. **Rising Difficulty**: Higher Circles come with greater challenges but also unleash far more powerful effects.
4. **The Perils of Black Sorcery**: Casting Black Sorcery inflicts corruption upon the caster, a dangerous burden.

### Casting a Spell

When you cast a spell:
1. **Resolve the Action**: Follow the usual process for resolving actions in the game.
2. **Consult the Oracle**: Use the outcomes below to determine the result:
   - **No, and...**: A catastrophic failure—roll on the **Mishap Table**.
   - **No**: The spell simply fails.
   - **No, but...**: The spell falters but creates a minor advantage.
   - **Yes, but...**: The spell succeeds with a minor drawback.
   - **Yes**: The spell works as intended.
   - **Yes, and...**: The spell succeeds spectacularly, creating an additional advantage.

### Luck Recovery

Luck replenishes at the end of a **Conflict**, as per the base rules. This cyclical restoration encourages risk-taking while ensuring spells remain a valuable but finite resource.

### Corruption and Frailty

**Black Sorcery** comes at a heavy cost:
1. Every use adds **1 Corruption Point** to the **Corruption Track**.
2. When the Corruption Track reaches **6 points**, reset it to zero and roll on the **Corruption Table** to determine a new **Frailty**.
3. Frailties are permanent and reflect the creeping taint of dark magic.

### Range Scale

The range of a spell determines how far its effects can reach. Spells in *Steel & Sorcery* use a narrative-driven range scale to keep descriptions thematic and flexible:

- **Touch**: Requires physical contact with the target or object. Ideal for close, personal effects or enchantments.
- **Close**: A few steps away, within a small room or immediate vicinity (approximately 10-20 feet).
- **Medium**: A moderate distance, covering the breadth of a large hall or open clearing (approximately 30-60 feet).
- **Long**: Spans a great distance, such as across a battlefield or an entire valley (approximately 100+ feet).
- **Unlimited**: The spell can target anywhere the caster has a connection to, often requiring a ritual or special focus.

Ranges are intentionally narrative rather than strict measurements, allowing the story to dictate their application. Always consider the context, terrain, and obstacles when determining if a spell’s range can reach its target.

### Acquiring New Spells

Learning spells requires in-game effort and a narrative justification. Spells can be acquired:

1. As **rewards** for completing story arcs.
2. Through **bargains** with magical entities.
3. By discovering **ancient tomes or relics**.

## Companions and Followers

Companions and followers add depth to the narrative by providing additional skills, moral dilemmas, and story hooks. They are treated as simplified characters with their own motivations and vulnerabilities, tied to the protagonist through a **Loyalty** mechanic. This system integrates seamlessly with the core mechanics of *Steel & Sorcery*.

### Creating a Companion
Companions are defined by a minimal set of traits:

1. **Concept**: A short phrase capturing their role and personality.
   - Examples: *"Cunning Scout,"* *"Jaded Mercenary,"* *"Faithful Beast,"* *"Cursed Alchemist."*

2. **Skill**: A single tag representing their primary ability.
   - Examples: *"Keen Tracker,"* *"Healing Touch,"* *"Ferocious Bite."*

3. **Frailty**: A vulnerability that might hinder them in certain situations.
   - Examples: *"Cowardly,"* *"Overzealous,"* *"Injured Leg."*

4. **Gear**: One piece of special equipment they carry or use.
   - Examples: *"Iron Bow,"* *"Alchemist’s Satchel,"* *"Rugged Cloak."*

5. **Loyalty**: A tracker that measures their connection to the protagonist, starting at **Neutral**.

### Loyalty

#### Loyalty Levels

Loyalty is a qualitative tag that reflects how the companion feels about the protagonist. It influences their willingness to assist, stay, or even betray. Use descriptive levels:

- **Devoted**: Willing to risk their life for the protagonist.
- **Loyal**: Committed to helping but with boundaries.
- **Neutral**: Cooperative but distant.
- **Doubtful**: Hesitant to assist, may question decisions.
- **Hostile**: Actively working against the protagonist or leaving.

#### Gaining and Losing Loyalty

Loyalty shifts based on the protagonist’s actions and the companion’s perspective. Consider the companion’s Concept, Skill, and Frailty when determining impact.

- **Gain Loyalty**:
  - Protecting or saving the companion in a dangerous situation.
  - Acting in alignment with their moral code or shared goals.
  - Gifting valuable resources or fulfilling their personal quests.
- **Lose Loyalty**:
  - Ignoring their advice or exposing them to unnecessary danger.
  - Betraying their trust or acting against their values.
  - Failing to assist them in critical moments.

#### Loyalty Changes

When an action might shift Loyalty, roll the Oracle:
- **Yes, and...**: Loyalty improves significantly (e.g., from *Neutral* to *Devoted*).
- **Yes**: Loyalty improves slightly (e.g., from *Neutral* to *Loyal*).
- **Yes, but...**: Loyalty improves, but at a cost (e.g., resources or reputation).
- **No, but...**: Loyalty decreases slightly but opens a chance for redemption.
- **No, and...**: Loyalty decreases significantly, leading to potential consequences (*Hostile*, betrayal, or departure).

### Using Companions in Gameplay

#### Assisting the Protagonist

- **Skill Rolls**: When the companion’s Skill is relevant, add a Chance Die for Advantage.
- **Independent Actions**: Companions can act on their own in scenes (e.g., scouting, creating distractions).
- **Sacrifices**: Devoted companions might intervene to shield the protagonist from harm, taking consequences on themselves.

#### Conflict Resolution

Companions can participate in conflicts, using their **Skill** and **Gear** to assist. However:
- They are more vulnerable than the protagonist. If they lose all their Luck or face a severe consequence, they might:
  - Suffer a permanent Frailty Tag (e.g., *"Shaken Spirit,"* *"Lost Arm"*).
  - Become Doubtful or Hostile in their Loyalty.
  - Die, depending on the narrative.

#### Managing Frailties

Companions’ Frailties can affect their performance. For example:
- A *"Cowardly"* companion might require a Loyalty roll to act under pressure.
- An *"Injured Leg"* might slow the group or prevent certain actions.

### Companion Examples

#### Scout: "Kara, Shadow Stalker"

- **Skill**: *"Silent Movement."*
- **Frailty**: *"Distrustful of Outsiders."*
- **Gear**: *"Iron Bow."*
- **Concept**: A cautious ranger with a tragic past, Kara excels in stealth but struggles to trust anyone.
- **Loyalty**: Starts as *Neutral*, leaning toward Doubtful if Kara feels unvalued.

#### Beast: "Skarn, Dire Wolf"

- **Skill**: *"Ferocious Bite."*
- **Frailty**: *"Fear of Fire."*
- **Gear**: *"Thick Hide (counts as light armor)."*
- **Concept**: A loyal dire wolf companion, protective but terrified of flames.
- **Loyalty**: Starts as *Loyal*, prone to Doubtful if the protagonist exposes Skarn to fire.

#### Mercenary: "Doran, Blades-for-Hire"

- **Skill**: *"Deadly Swordsmanship."*
- **Frailty**: *"Greedy."*
- **Gear**: *"Steel Greatsword."*
- **Concept**: A capable fighter motivated by coin rather than ideals.
- **Loyalty**: Starts as *Neutral*, gaining Loyalty through gold or lucrative missions.

### Companion Downtime

Companions can also benefit from downtime activities:

1. **Healing Frailties**: Use Rest and Recovery rules to heal companion injuries or resolve their doubts.
2. **Training**: Allow companions to gain new Skills or improve existing ones.
3. **Bonding**: Spend downtime building rapport with companions to improve Loyalty (e.g., shared stories, gifts, or meaningful gestures).

### Optional: Companion Betrayal
If Loyalty drops to *Hostile*, a companion might betray the protagonist. Use the Oracle to determine the nature of the betrayal:

- **Yes, and...**: The betrayal is devastating (e.g., they sabotage a critical mission).
- **Yes**: They leave the group, possibly returning as a rival.
- **Yes, but...**: Their betrayal is reluctant, leaving room for reconciliation.
- **No, but...**: They stay but remain untrustworthy.
- **No, and...**: The companion remains loyal despite doubts.

## Optional Rules

### Morality and Reputation

This system introduces two interconnected elements: **Morality**, which reflects the character’s personal ethical compass, and **Reputation**, which determines how various groups or supernatural forces perceive them. Both are qualitative, tag-based systems that integrate seamlessly with the game's existing mechanics.

#### **Morality**

Morality is defined by **tags** that represent key actions, decisions, or patterns of behavior. These tags do not dictate gameplay but serve as narrative prompts and influence interactions with the world.

Whenever the character performs a morally significant action, assign a **Morality Tag** that represents their choice.

Examples:  
- *"Merciful Executioner"* (spared a foe but left them crippled)
- *"Blood-Soaked Avenger"* (took violent revenge)
- *"Oathbreaker"* (betrayed a solemn vow)
- *"Guardian of the Weak"* (defended the helpless)
- *"Desecrator"* (defiled a sacred place)
- *"Redeemer"* (helped an enemy seek forgiveness)

1. **Tag Tracking**: List all Morality Tags on the character sheet, organized by themes (e.g., *Justice*, *Power*, *Faith*).
2. **Influence on Play**: When a Morality Tag applies to a situation, it can:
   - Grant **Advantage** or **Disadvantage** in rolls, depending on the context.
   - Trigger unique narrative events or interactions.
3. **Tag Evolution**: As the narrative progresses, combine or refine existing tags to reflect character growth. For example, *"Merciful Executioner"* might evolve into *"Reluctant Warrior of Justice."*

#### Reputation

Reputation reflects how the character is perceived by specific **Factions**, **Groups**, or **Supernatural Forces**. Like Morality, it uses **tags**, but these are tied to the character's standing with external entities.

Each faction or force has a **Reputation Track**, starting as **Neutral**. As the character interacts with them, tags are assigned to denote their standing.

Examples:  
- With the *Cult of the Drowned God*: *"Profane Heretic"* or *"Blessed Vessel."*
- With the *Ironleaf Clans*: *"Bloodbound Ally"* or *"Oathbreaker."*

1. Create a simple list of **Factions or Forces** relevant to the game.
2. Assign **Reputation Tags** based on significant interactions or actions taken.
3. Reputation tags are narrative, not numerical. For example:
   - *"Feared Champion of the Wastes"* with the *Nomads of the Wailing Steppes*.
   - *"Bearer of Cursed Knowledge"* with a *Supernatural Entity*.
   - *"Traitor to the Throne"* with a ruling kingdom.

#### Interaction Between Morality and Reputation

Morality and Reputation can influence each other:
1. **Reputation Impact**: A Morality Tag might alter how factions perceive the character. For example:
   - *"Merciful Executioner"* could lead a benevolent faction to tag the character as *"Worthy of Trust"* but a cruel faction to tag them as *"Weak."*
2. **Moral Dilemmas**: Reputation might pressure the character into actions that conflict with their morality. For example:
   - A faction demands the character burn a sacred grove to prove loyalty, challenging their *"Guardian of the Forest"* Morality Tag.

### Heroic Feats

Heroic Feats represent moments of extraordinary effort where a character achieves the nearly impossible. These feats allow players to create dramatic, impactful scenes that transcend normal limits. However, such actions come at a cost, introducing tension and consequences.

1. **Earning Destiny Points**:
   - Characters start each session or adventure with **1 Destiny Point**.
   - Additional Destiny Points can be earned through:
     - Completing significant story milestones.
     - Overcoming major challenges or adversaries.
     - Roleplaying intense moments of sacrifice or moral conflict (e.g., giving up a personal goal to save others).

2. **Spending Destiny Points**:
   - A Destiny Point is spent to perform a **Heroic Feat**, allowing the player to achieve something remarkable or improbable.
   - Once spent, the Destiny Point is gone and can only be replenished by earning it again through gameplay.

When a character attempts a Heroic Feat:
1. **Declare the Feat**: The player describes what extraordinary action they want to achieve. Examples include:
   - Defeating a powerful foe in a single stroke.
   - Leaping across a chasm with no possible fallback.
   - Convincing a hostile faction leader to call off an attack.
   - Casting a spell far beyond the normal bounds of magic.
2. **Spend a Destiny Point**: Burn a Destiny Point to activate the feat.
3. **Resolve the Feat**:
   - Roll the Oracle as usual but with a twist:
     - Success is more likely, but failure introduces a dramatic cost.
     - Use Advantage (add a **Chance Die**) to reflect the extraordinary effort.
   - The outcome of the roll dictates the result, modified by the Twist Counter if necessary.

#### Heroic Feat Outcomes

| Oracle Result   | Heroic Feat Outcome                                                   | Cost                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | The feat succeeds spectacularly, exceeding expectations.              | Gain a Morality or Reputation Tag (positive or neutral).             |
| **Yes**         | The feat succeeds as intended.                                        | The character suffers a minor setback (e.g., temporary exhaustion).  |
| **Yes, but...** | The feat succeeds, but there’s an immediate complication.             | The Twist Counter increases by 1 or a Frailty Tag is triggered.      |
| **No, but...**  | The feat fails, but something beneficial happens as a consolation.    | The character loses an important resource (Gear, Luck, Reputation).  |
| **No**          | The feat fails outright.                                              | The character suffers significant consequences (e.g., injury, loss). |
| **No, and...**  | The feat fails catastrophically, worsening the situation.             | A major cost is imposed (e.g., permanent damage or narrative shift). |

#### Costs of Heroic Feats

Heroic Feats are powerful but taxing. Spending a Destiny Point often introduces a **cost** beyond the immediate roll result. Examples include:
- **Physical Costs**: Exhaustion, temporary or permanent loss of Luck, or Frailty Tags (*"Weakened,"* *"Drained of Energy"*).
- **Narrative Costs**: Allies’ disapproval, gaining a negative Reputation Tag (*"Reckless Desperado"*), or provoking a powerful enemy.
- **Environmental Costs**: Collateral damage, such as causing a landslide or breaking a fragile alliance.

### Downtime Activities

Downtime activities provide a structured way to develop the character and their story between adventures. These activities allow players to spend time improving their gear, recovering from injuries, crafting items, building alliances, or learning new skills. The downtime system integrates with the tag-based mechanics of *Steel & Sorcery*, ensuring simplicity while enriching the narrative.

#### Downtime Actions

During downtime, the character can choose one or more activities. Each activity typically takes one "unit" of time, such as a day, a week, or a season, depending on the campaign's pace. 

**1. Rest and Recovery**  
Focus on healing long-term injuries, removing Frailty Tags, and recovering from narrative consequences of past events.
  
Roll the Oracle to determine the effectiveness of recovery efforts:
- **Yes**: Remove one Frailty Tag or mitigate a significant consequence (e.g., healing a serious wound or clearing a *"Cursed"* condition).
- **Yes, and...**: Fully recover and gain a beneficial Tag (e.g., *"Resilient"* or *"Hardened Survivor"*).
- **No, but...**: Recovery is incomplete—gain partial relief, but the injury persists in a diminished form (e.g., *"Weakened Arm"* becomes *"Sore Limb"*).
- **No, and...**: Recovery fails, and the injury worsens or introduces new complications (e.g., gaining an additional Frailty Tag like *"Lingering Pain"*).

**2. Crafting**  
Create or repair gear, enchant items, or brew potions.

- Declare the item to be crafted and any special qualities it should have (e.g., *"Lightweight Armor,"* *"Poisoned Dagger"*).

  - *Yes*: Gain or enhance a Skill Tag.
  - *Yes, and...*: Gain additional insight, adding a related Gear or Frailty Tag (*"Shattered Shieldmaster"* evolves into *"Master of the Broken Defense."*).
  - *No, but...*: The training is incomplete, but the character gains partial benefits (e.g., temporary Advantage in a specific scenario).
  - *No, and...*: Training backfires, causing frustration or physical strain (gain a Frailty Tag like *"Injured Wrist."*).

**4. Building Alliances**  
Forge relationships with factions, NPCs, or groups.

- Declare the group and your intention (e.g., *"Convince the Shadow Guild to ally with me."*).
- Roll the Oracle:
  - *Yes*: The alliance is formed, granting a Reputation Tag (*"Trusted by the Shadow Guild."*).
  - *Yes, and...*: The alliance provides immediate aid or resources.
  - *No, but...*: The negotiation fails, but there’s a chance to revisit the opportunity later.
  - *No, and...*: The attempt worsens relations, creating a negative Reputation Tag (*"Enemy of the Shadow Guild."*).

**5. Research**  
Investigate lore, uncover secrets, or analyze magical artifacts.

- Declare the subject of research (e.g., *"The Crown of Khemru"* or *"The Riverlands’ Hidden Vaults"*).
- Roll the Oracle:
  - *Yes*: Learn key information.
  - *Yes, and...*: Discover an additional, unexpected clue or opportunity.
  - *No, but...*: Partial information is gained, but it’s incomplete or misleading.
  - *No, and...*: The research triggers unintended consequences (e.g., a faction learns of your interest).

**6. Exploration Preparation**    
Plan your next adventure, scout locations, or stock up on supplies.

Roll the Oracle to assess the success of your preparation:

- *Yes*: Gain a useful map, item, or advantage for the journey.
- *Yes, and...*: Discover a shortcut or unexpected resource.
- *No, but...*: Gather incomplete information, leading to potential challenges.
- *No, and...*: The preparation backfires, introducing a hazard or false lead.

#### Costs and Risks

Downtime activities often require resources, and failure can introduce complications:
1. **Resource Costs**:
   - **Healing:** Payment for healers or materials for poultices.
   - **Crafting:** Rare components or tools.
   - **Training:** Access to mentors or texts.
   - **Alliances:** Gold, favors, or reputation sacrifices.
2. **Complications**:
   - Failed rolls might generate new Frailty Tags (*"Exhausted,"* *"In Debt"*).
   - Introduce risks like rival crafters sabotaging your work or factions becoming suspicious of your motives.

## Travel and Survival

Travel and survival in *Steel & Sorcery* are essential to the sense of adventure and danger. These mechanics introduce environmental hazards, resource management, and procedural exploration while tying into the core resolution system. This system ensures that the journey itself becomes a rich narrative filled with challenges, discoveries, and hard choices.

### Travel Phases

A journey is broken into three distinct phases: **Preparation**, **Journey**, and **Arrival**.

#### 1. Preparation
Before embarking, the protagonist prepares for the journey by determining their destination, gathering resources, and setting priorities.

- **Choose Your Destination**:
  - Decide where you’re headed and why. The Oracle can help determine a rumored location or plot-relevant goal.
  - Example Questions for the Oracle:
    - *"Is the location nearby?"*
    - *"Does the destination have a specific danger?"*

- **Stock Up on Supplies**
  - Supplies include food, water, medical kits, and special equipment. Create Tags for key items, like *"Weeks of Rations"* or *"Portable Shelter."*
  - Roll the Oracle to determine if preparation succeeds.
    - **Yes, and...**: Gain high-quality or surplus supplies (*"Extra Dry Rations"* or *"Weatherproof Cloak"*).
    - **Yes**: You gather adequate supplies for the journey, meeting basic needs without issues.
    - **Yes, but...**: You gather enough supplies, but some are of lower quality (*"Stale Rations"* or *"Damaged Water Flask"*).
    - **No, but...**: Supplies are insufficient, but you manage to find a partial substitute (*"Foraged Food"* or *"Improvised Shelter"*).
    - **No**: You fail to gather enough supplies, leaving the group underprepared for the journey.
    - **No, and...**: Supplies are insufficient, or an essential item is missing (*"Forgot the Compass"*), and the attempt results in wasted time or other consequences (*"Lose 1 Luck"*).

#### **2. The Journey**

The journey itself involves managing resources, navigating hazards, and uncovering opportunities.

##### **A. Progress and Pace**
- The speed of travel determines how many rolls or events occur along the way:
  - **Fast Pace**: Cover more distance but risk higher exhaustion or missed opportunities.
  - **Slow Pace**: Travel cautiously, reducing risks but increasing time and resource consumption.
- Roll the Oracle to check if progress is smooth or interrupted:
  - **Yes, and...**: Advance smoothly and find something beneficial (a shortcut, hidden trail, or safe resting spot).
  - **Yes**: Advance without incident, making steady progress.
  - **Yes, but...**: Progress is made, but a minor inconvenience arises (e.g., light rain, minor injury).
  - **No, but...**: Progress is delayed, but you gain useful information or resources (e.g., scout an alternate route, discover fresh water).
  - **No**: Progress is significantly slowed due to a challenge (e.g., a fallen tree, washed-out path).
  - **No, and...**: A major obstacle halts progress entirely (e.g., blocked canyon, bandit ambush).

### **B. Resource Management**
Track the depletion of supplies using Tags.
- Example:
  - *"Weeks of Rations"* might degrade into *"Low Rations"* or *"Spoiled Food"*.
- At the end of each day or travel segment, roll the Oracle to determine resource consumption:
  - **Yes, and...**: Supplies hold up perfectly and are even conserved (*"Extra Rations Remaining"*).
  - **Yes**: Resources hold up fine, no issues.
  - **Yes, but...**: Resources are adequate but slightly diminished (*"Reduced Rations"*).
  - **No, but...**: Supplies are depleted, but you can make do with substitutes (*"Foraged Food"* or *"Watered Down Provisions"*).
  - **No**: Supplies are significantly depleted, leaving the group underprepared.
  - **No, and...**: Resources are not only depleted but damaged or lost (*"Spoiled Water"* or *"Torn Food Sack"*).

### **C. Foraging and Scavenging**
Characters can attempt to gather food, water, or other materials to replenish resources.
- Roll the Oracle to determine the outcome:
  - **Yes, and...**: Gather abundant supplies, including rare or valuable finds (*"Wild Game and Medicinal Herbs"*).
  - **Yes**: Gather enough supplies for a day (*"Fresh Berries,"* *"River Water"*).
  - **Yes, but...**: Gather enough to survive but with drawbacks (e.g., low-quality food or difficult terrain).
  - **No, but...**: Gather only minimal supplies and face potential risks (*"Barely Enough Water"*).
  - **No**: Foraging fails, resulting in hunger or thirst.
  - **No, and...**: Foraging fails and triggers a danger (*"Attracts Predator"* or *"Poisonous Plants Consumed"*).

### **D. Environmental Hazards**
Hazards create tension and test survival skills. Use the Oracle to determine if the group encounters a hazard and how they handle it.

- Roll the Oracle to determine how the hazard affects progress:
  - **Yes, and...**: Hazard is avoided entirely, and the group benefits (e.g., spotting a safe path or bypassing danger).
  - **Yes**: Hazard is avoided or managed without issues.
  - **Yes, but...**: The hazard is managed, but it consumes resources or causes minor harm (*"Lost Water Bottle,"* *"Sprained Ankle"*).
  - **No, but...**: The hazard causes minor damage or delays but reveals an opportunity (*"Hidden Cave for Shelter"*).
  - **No**: The hazard causes significant delays or harm (*"Lost Supplies in Quicksand"*).
  - **No, and...**: The hazard is disastrous, causing severe setbacks or injuries (*"Injured Party Member,"* *"Severe Storm Damage"*).

| D6 Roll | Hazard Type              | Example                            |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1       | Weather                  | Blizzard, sandstorm, torrential rain. |
| 2       | Terrain                  | Landslide, quicksand, narrow cliffs. |
| 3       | Wild Creatures           | Predator attack, venomous insects. |
| 4       | Lack of Resources        | Dried riverbed, barren landscape.  |
| 5       | Disease or Sickness      | Food poisoning, heatstroke.        |
| 6       | Ambush                   | Bandits, rival adventurers.        |

##### E. Weather Impacts
Dynamic weather influences survival and travel.

- Roll for weather at the start of each travel day.
- Characters may attempt to mitigate weather effects (e.g., setting up shelter, changing routes).

| D6 Roll | Weather Condition        | Effect                             |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1       | Clear                    | Normal progress.                   |
| 2       | Overcast                 | Dulls morale, harder to navigate.  |
| 3       | Rain                     | Slows progress, risk of illness.   |
| 4       | Storm                    | Halts travel, damages supplies.    |
| 5       | Extreme Heat or Cold     | Exhaustion, faster resource depletion. |
| 6       | Magical or Unnatural     | Reality warps, curses, strange phenomena. |

### **3. Arrival**

Upon reaching the destination, determine what awaits.

##### **Location Discovery**
Roll the Oracle to describe the location:

- **Yes, and...**: The location matches expectations and offers a significant bonus (e.g., *"A hidden ally is waiting,"* *"A trove of ancient artifacts"*).
- **Yes**: The location matches expectations and is as anticipated (e.g., *"The ruins are intact, ready to explore"*).
- **Yes, but...**: The location matches expectations but presents a minor complication (e.g., *"Partially flooded ruins,"* *"Tensions with locals"*).
- **No, but...**: The location is not what you expected, but there’s a silver lining (e.g., *"The town is abandoned, but you find a useful map"*).
- **No**: The destination is not what you expected and offers no immediate advantages (e.g., *"The ruins have been looted"*).
- **No, and...**: The destination is more dangerous or useless than expected (e.g., *"A powerful foe is occupying the area,"* *"The cave leads to a deadly trap"*).

##### Rest and Recover

Safe destinations allow downtime for recovery or resupply. Use downtime rules to resolve actions like healing or building alliances.

## The Shrouded Continent of Khor’Dara

Khor’Dara is a mythical lost continent, cloaked in shadow and intrigue, its existence debated by philosophers and storytellers alike. Some claim it lies beyond the uncharted seas of the ancient world, while others insist it slumbers beneath the surface, deep within the Hollow Earth, accessible only through forgotten fissures and labyrinthine caves. In this timeless epoch, where primeval forces vie with men and gods alike, Khor’Dara exists as a testament to the precarious balance between ambition and ruin.

The land is defined by stark contrasts: untamed wilderness where colossal beasts prowl and the laws of nature warp unpredictably; decadent city-states where wealth pools in gilded ziggurats, while the shadows teem with intrigue and unrest; and borderlands where neither civilization nor chaos holds sway, leaving space for nomadic tribes, rogue warlords, and things best left unnamed. Magic weaves through Khor’Dara like an unsteady pulse—feared for its corruption, yet coveted for its power. It is a force both divine and perilous, marking those who wield it with scars of their arrogance or desperation.

Think Khor’Dara as a mix of **Bronze Age Near East**, **Mesopotamia**, and **pre-classical Mediterranean cultures**, blending these influences into a rich, multifaceted world:

- **Architecture**: The cities of Khor’Dara are monumental in both scale and symbolism, built to exalt the gods and intimidate rivals. Towering ziggurats spiral toward the heavens, their facades inscribed with myths and blood-stained edicts. Hanging gardens cascade from palace rooftops, cultivated by priests as offerings to fickle deities. Obsidian fortresses loom over the plains, their polished walls reflecting light like a veil of fire at dusk. Deep within city centers, labyrinthine palaces house the ruling elite, their echoing halls lit by braziers and adorned with mosaics depicting conquest, divinity, and despair.

- **Religion**: The gods of Khor’Dara are mercurial, demanding devotion through rituals as grand as they are harrowing. Each deity governs both aspects of nature and the human condition, embodying contradictions that reflect their flawed worshippers. Storm gods who bring rain to the fields might also unleash tempests that flatten entire villages; a mother goddess who nurtures life might demand offerings of blood to ensure fertility. Priests, wielding immense political power, serve as intermediaries between gods and mortals, though their own ambitions often eclipse divine will. On the fringes of society, cults of outcasts and dreamers flourish, their rites whispered of in darkened streets, their faith fueled by promises of forbidden power.

- **Technology**: Civilization in Khor’Dara walks a knife's edge, with progress often overshadowed by hubris and disaster. Bronze weapons gleam in the hands of soldiers who ride into battle on war chariots, their wheels rattling across dry earth. Engineers construct canals and reservoirs to stave off famine, only for earthquakes or floods to reduce their works to ruins. Massive stone edifices bear witness to humanity's attempt to tame nature, but each one whispers of the countless lives spent to carve its grandeur. Tools of bone, clay, and metal coexist in this fragile balance, shaped by the ingenuity of craftsmen and the scarcity of resources.

- **Society**: The social order of Khor’Dara is rigid and unyielding, mirroring the unforgiving gods who shaped it. At the top sit rulers who claim divine descent, their authority enforced by hierarchies of priests, generals, and bureaucrats. Beneath them, merchants trade goods along treacherous roads and rivers, their influence often rivaling that of nobility. Laborers toil in the fields and quarries, their sweat and blood feeding both the granaries and the temples. At the bottom lie slaves and outcasts, many of whom cling to forbidden magics or band together in the wilderness to forge new lives—or enact vengeance. Society is at once cohesive and volatile, a fragile tapestry ready to unravel under the weight of rebellion, disaster, or divine wrath.

### Themes

- **Survival vs. Civilization**: In Khor’Dara, survival is a battle against both the untamed wilderness and the decadence of civilization. The wilderness teems with colossal predators, venomous flora, and shifting landscapes that obey no mortal law. Nomadic tribes must adapt constantly to the unpredictable forces of nature, crafting lives of resilience and ingenuity. Yet, civilization offers no true refuge—its cities are plagued by corruption, disease, and the ever-present threat of invasion. Heroes often find themselves straddling these two worlds, torn between the freedom of the frontier and the treacherous comforts of urban life. Each path presents its own perils: in the wilderness, nature itself conspires against you; in the cities, betrayal and excess rot the soul.

- **Ambition and Hubris**: Khor’Dara is a land where ambition can raise empires or invite utter ruin. Kings and priests reach for divine power, only to unleash curses that plague their lands. Sorcerers delve into forbidden magics, sacrificing their humanity in pursuit of immortality. Even the commoner dreams of riches or escape, but in Khor’Dara, desire often becomes a double-edged blade. Myths and ruins litter the land as grim reminders of what happens when mortals defy the natural order or overreach their bounds. Every choice carries the weight of consequence, and in the end, even the gods may prove powerless to undo the damage wrought by mortal hubris.

- **Moral Ambiguity**: In Khor’Dara, good and evil are seldom clear. The righteous are often forced to compromise, while the wicked may show moments of surprising compassion. A warlord who butchers his enemies may also protect his people from worse fates, while a priest who offers healing might exact a price too steep for any to bear. The world demands choices that blur the lines of morality: Do you ally with a tyrant to save your village, or let it burn for the sake of principle? Do you plunder a sacred temple to feed your starving tribe, knowing the gods may curse you for it? Heroes must tread carefully, for every decision casts ripples that may come crashing back as tidal waves.

- **Mystery and Wonder**: Khor’Dara is a realm where the veil between the mundane and the supernatural is tantalizingly thin. Magic seeps from the land itself, manifesting as both miracle and menace. Ancient ruins whisper of civilizations whose knowledge surpasses comprehension, their artifacts luring the brave and foolish alike with promises of power. Titans, elder gods, and spectral forces linger in the shadows, their true motives inscrutable. Even the landscape defies understanding: deserts that echo with the voices of the dead, mountains that hum with otherworldly melodies, and rifts that lead to realms unbound by time. Every corner of Khor’Dara holds a secret, and those who seek to uncover its truths must prepare to be awed—or undone—by what they find.

### Lands of Conflict

#### **Geographical Regions**

- **The Wailing Steppes**: These endless plains stretch to the horizon, dotted with clusters of ancient burial mounds and weathered monoliths. The nomadic tribes who roam this harsh land are masters of endurance, hunting colossal megafauna like woolly saurians and horned thunderbeasts with spears crafted from bone and flint. At night, the winds howl through the open expanse, carrying whispers that chill even the bravest souls. Tribes claim these are the voices of restless ancestors or forgotten gods, and to ignore them is to court misfortune. Rival clans often clash in brutal skirmishes over hunting grounds, their blood soaking the earth that sustains them.

- **The Spine of Kharn**: Jagged peaks rise like the shattered ribs of a fallen titan, casting long shadows over the valleys below. Treacherous paths wind through the mountains, luring travelers with the promise of hidden treasures. Ancient ruins, half-buried in snow and rockslides, whisper of a lost civilization whose stone-skinned sentinels still patrol the heights. The air here is thin and sharp, carrying the cries of monstrous predators that stalk the cliffs. Those who dare these heights speak of storms that appear from nowhere, howling with a supernatural fury that drives even the hardiest mountaineers to their knees.

- **The Verdant Abyss**: A suffocating canopy of greenery casts this jungle into perpetual twilight, its air heavy with the scent of decay and the constant buzz of unseen insects. Massive predators, their scales and feathers gleaming with hues unseen in the outside world, stalk the dense undergrowth. The flora is no less deadly—vines that constrict like serpents, blossoms that exhale toxic mists, and trees that seem to move when no one is watching. Crumbling temples and ziggurats, overrun by moss and vines, hide the remnants of an elder race whose motives remain inscrutable. Explorers often vanish here, their fates whispered about in fearful tones.

- **The Scorched Wastes**: Once the fertile breadbasket of Khor’Dara, this land is now a desolate expanse of cracked earth and shimmering heat. Great fissures scar the ground, belching occasional plumes of sulfur and flame. Travelers speak of mirages that tempt the desperate with visions of cool waters and lush oases, only to vanish at the last moment. Fire-spirits known as **Ember Wraiths** patrol the dunes, their glowing eyes the last thing many see before their demise. Despite the peril, the Wastes are said to conceal vast treasures from the days when this was a thriving heartland—artifacts too precious to be left undisturbed.

- **The Riverlands of Nurim**: This sprawling delta is a labyrinth of slow-moving waterways, teeming with life both mundane and mystical. Crocodilian beasts larger than warships lurk beneath the surface, while river spirits, their forms shimmering with the hues of flowing water, exact harsh tolls from those who trespass. Exiled nobles and rogue shamans make their homes among the scattered islands, ruling over makeshift fiefdoms or staging daring raids on merchant vessels. The rivers themselves are fickle, their courses shifting unpredictably after storms or floods, and the fertile soil along the banks often becomes a battleground for rival factions.

- **The Cloud Marches**: Rolling highlands where the land seems to touch the sky, the Cloud Marches are a place of stark beauty and unrelenting danger. Herds of massive, shaggy beasts graze on windswept grasslands, their migrations contested by nomadic clans and ambitious settlers alike. The skies above teem with monstrous birds of prey whose talons can carry off a horse, while lightning storms, laced with supernatural energy, ignite the landscape without warning. Small shrines dot the ridges, dedicated to deities of storm and wind, and the locals believe these offerings keep the worst of the Marches’ wrath at bay.

- **The Weeping Forest**: An expanse of towering trees whose gnarled roots rise like barricades above the forest floor, the Weeping Forest earns its name from the eerie sound of dripping water that echoes through its depths, even in dry seasons. Strange lights flicker between the trunks, leading the unwary astray, while settlers whisper of a shadowy figure known only as the **Forest King**, who guards the land against those who seek to exploit it. Some claim to have glimpsed antlered silhouettes moving just beyond the edge of vision, while others speak of trees that seem to watch with hollow, knothole eyes.

#### **Supernatural Landscapes**

- **The Veil of Muon**: This shimmering desert is less a place and more a distortion of reality itself. The air ripples with an iridescent haze, and the boundaries of time and space falter. Explorers often stumble upon their own footprints—only to find they lead to the bones of their future selves. Ghostly figures appear at the edge of sight, their forms fractured and unreal, offering cryptic warnings or guidance. Those who survive the Veil speak of finding objects out of time—jewels from forgotten empires or tools from lands yet to be born.

- **The Singing Peaks**: These mountains resonate with a constant, haunting hum that grows louder as one ascends. Legends say this melody is the mourning song of the Titans, whose bones rest beneath the stone. Avalanches and earthquakes plague the region, leading some to believe the Titans are not as dead as they seem. The peaks glow faintly at night, their rocks laced with veins of phosphorescent minerals. Seekers of forbidden knowledge often come here to commune with the Titans' lingering essence, though few return unchanged.

- **The Abyssal Rift**: A gaping chasm that splits the continent’s heart, the Abyssal Rift is a place of wonder and dread. Its edges are overgrown with glowing fungal forests, whose bioluminescent spores drift like ghostly fireflies in the still air. Strange, predatory creatures prowl these shadowed woods, their forms alien and unsettling. At the rift’s depths lies the rumored cradle of an ancient civilization, its ruins humming faintly with unearthly power. Few dare to descend into the Rift, and those who return often speak of voices in the dark and an overwhelming sense of being watched.

### Tribes and Survivors

#### Dominant Cultures

- **Skycallers of the Steppes**: The Skycallers are nomads who view the ever-shifting winds as sacred, believing them to carry the whispers of ancestors and the decrees of forgotten gods. They craft their weapons from the bones of the megafauna they hunt, their blades and spear tips etched with prayers that channel the winds' blessings. Shamans play a pivotal role in their society, standing at the nexus of spiritual guidance and survival. These figures claim to hear the voices of ancestors carried by the gales and are often consulted before major hunts, battles, or migrations. Skycaller warriors are famed for their agility and ferocity, often attacking with blinding speed on horseback, using the terrain and wind to their advantage. To lose touch with the wind, either by betrayal or exile, is considered a fate worse than death.

- **Children of Khemru**: Deep in the fetid swamps, the Children of Khemru thrive under the rule of necromancer-kings who claim dominion over life and death. Their society revolves around a grim cycle of decay and rebirth, mirrored in their belief that the swamp itself is a living entity, simultaneously nurturing and devouring. The necromancer-kings extend their reign through undead servitors, which patrol the murky waters and guard their temples. Commoners live in fear of their rulers but also view them as indispensable protectors against the swamp’s many dangers, including venomous predators and rival tribes. Ritual sacrifices are common, their blood feeding both the land and the magic of the necromancers. The Children of Khemru craft boats and tools from the swamp’s abundant resources, their resilience as remarkable as their morbid customs.

- **Ironleaf Clans**: Hidden within the towering trees of the Weeping Forest, the Ironleaf Clans are fierce warriors and master craftsmen who use the enchanted wood of their home to create weapons and armor with almost supernatural qualities. They speak of a mysterious figure known as the **Forest King**, a shadowy guardian said to guide their hunts and punish those who disrespect the balance of the forest. Clan life is communal, with decisions made in council by the eldest hunters and shamans, though leadership is earned through acts of bravery and cunning. Outsiders who enter the forest uninvited often disappear, their fates attributed to the Forest King or the Ironleaf scouts, who strike from the shadows with uncanny precision. Their bond with the forest is absolute, and they will defend it to their last breath, even if it means leaving their own kind to die for the greater good.

#### Social Structures

The societies of Khor’Dara reflect the harsh realities of survival, each adapted to their environment in unique ways:  
- **Tribal Societies**: Tribes are often small, tight-knit groups, their cohesion ensured by bonds of blood, shared struggle, or spiritual favor. Leadership is rarely hereditary; instead, it is claimed by strength, cunning, or an individual's connection to the divine. Challenges to leadership are common, often resolved through ritualized combat or grueling trials. Those who fail to contribute—whether through weakness, betrayal, or laziness—are exiled, left to wander the wilderness or join the ranks of marauding outcasts.  
- **City-States**: By contrast, city-states like Zhara or Khemru are rigidly hierarchical. Nobles and priest-kings sit at the top, enforcing their will through soldiers and bureaucrats. Below them, merchants wield power through wealth and trade, while laborers toil endlessly to support the cities' grandeur. Slaves and outcasts form the bottom tier, their lives often forfeit to feed the insatiable ambitions of the ruling class.  
- **Cults and Outsiders**: Outside these structures lie outcast factions, scavenger tribes, and wandering mystics. Many are remnants of fallen civilizations or groups who defied social norms, eking out precarious existences on the fringes of Khor’Dara.

#### Survival Hierarchies  
Each tribe or settlement defines its hierarchy by what it values most:  
- **Strength**: Warriors rise to prominence in societies that value might above all else. Among the Skycallers and the Ironleaf Clans, prowess in battle or the hunt earns leadership and respect.  
- **Cunning**: In regions like the Riverlands, where survival often hinges on strategy and guile, leaders are those who can outwit rivals and secure resources.  
- **Divine Favor**: In the Children of Khemru and many city-states, spiritual authority dominates. Shamans and priests claim their place by interpreting omens, commanding magic, or earning the gods' blessings.  

Failure to meet these expectations can result in severe consequences, from public humiliation to exile, or even ritual sacrifice in the more spiritually charged societies.

#### Warrior Traditions  
Khor’Dara’s warriors are brutal pragmatists, their techniques honed by centuries of hardship and conflict:  
- **Guerilla Tactics**: The Ironleaf Clans strike like phantoms from the shadows, vanishing into the trees before retaliation is possible. They use their enchanted wooden weapons with deadly precision, exploiting their intimate knowledge of the forest.  
- **Mounted Combat**: The Skycallers dominate the steppes with their bone-tipped spears and swift, sure-footed mounts. Their riders are trained from childhood, bonding with their horses in a sacred ceremony believed to be blessed by the wind itself.  
- **Necromantic Forces**: The Children of Khemru supplement their mortal soldiers with legions of undead, who march tirelessly through the swamps to enforce the will of their kings. However, their true strength lies in their ability to sow terror—facing an unkillable enemy often breaks their opponents before battle begins.  
- **Ritual Duels**: Across Khor’Dara, disputes are often settled through duels, which serve both as displays of prowess and as sacred acts of justice. These duels are rarely to the death, though the losing party often suffers exile or permanent injury as a mark of defeat. The terms of combat vary widely: a duel in the Scorched Wastes might involve flaming blades, while the Weeping Forest favors contests of stealth and ambush.

### Powers and Intrigues

#### **Rival City-States**  

- **The Obsidian Spire of Zhara**: Rising from the flanks of a perpetually smoldering volcano, Zhara is both a beacon of power and a harbinger of destruction. Its obsidian walls glisten like dark mirrors, reflecting the fires of the earth below. The sorcerer-priests of Zhara draw their strength from blood magic, performing elaborate rites that keep the volcano in check—or so they claim. These rituals are spectacles of horror and devotion, involving the sacrifice of slaves, prisoners, and even willing acolytes who believe their deaths will ensure the city's survival. Beneath its fiery exterior, Zhara is a crucible of treachery. Merchant lords jockey for influence, using poisoned wines and cursed artifacts to eliminate rivals. Spies lurk in every shadow, and the city's labyrinthine undercroft is said to house the **Chamber of Unspoken Deals**, where assassins and informants ply their trades. Despite its dangers, Zhara thrives on trade, exporting volcanic glass, rare gems, and enchanted obsidian weaponry coveted by warlords across Khor’Dara.

- **Lunhai, the Pearl City**: Nestled along the shores of an inland sea that gleams like liquid silver, Lunhai is a city of opulence and decay. Its gleaming towers are adorned with mother-of-pearl mosaics, and its canals wind through markets overflowing with spices, silks, and exotic beasts. Yet beneath this veneer of splendor lies rot. The city's nobles, clad in garments that shimmer like the ocean, indulge in opium-fueled orgies and wine-drenched feasts, their wealth wrung from the labor of the impoverished masses. Lunhai harbors a darker secret: the cult of the **Drowned God**, a shadowy faith that worships the primordial entity said to sleep beneath the sea. Cult rituals, conducted in the dead of night, involve drowning initiates in sacred pools before reviving them as devout servants. Whispers claim the canals themselves are cursed, with figures glimpsed just beneath the surface—neither living nor dead. For all its beauty, Lunhai is a place where the tides of ambition and despair drown even the mightiest.

- **Khemru, the Sunken Crown**: Half-lost to the fetid swamps, Khemru is a city where death is not an end but a beginning. Its necromancer-kings, wrapped in golden funerary masks, command legions of undead to maintain their crumbling dominion. Towering ziggurats rise from the swamp’s mire, their steps slick with algae and gilded with offerings to dark gods. Life here is a grim affair, with commoners toiling under the watchful gaze of skeletal sentinels, their labors often interrupted by the need to appease the city's rulers with sacrifices. Yet even in Khemru, power is not absolute. Rival necromancers scheme against one another, and rumors of insurrection stir among the living populace. The swamp itself resists the necromancers' control; strange will-o’-the-wisps lure travelers to watery graves, and ancient beasts rise from the muck to lay waste to undead patrols. Despite its squalor, Khemru is a repository of forbidden knowledge, its archives filled with tomes on necromancy, curses, and the manipulation of life and death.

#### **Mercenary Alliances**  
Khor’Dara's fractured politics have birthed a thriving culture of mercenary companies, each with its own creed, reputation, and price. These bands range from disciplined legions to ragtag groups of cutthroats, their services available to anyone who can pay. Some of the most feared alliances include:  
- **The Black Talons**: Elite sellswords clad in blackened bronze, known for their unswerving loyalty to contracts. Their banner, marked with a clawed gauntlet, strikes fear into any battlefield.  
- **The Ember Wolves**: A nomadic band infamous for their scorched-earth tactics, their leader, **Kaerath the Burned**, is said to wield a flaming blade forged in Zhara.  
- **The Ghosts of Nurim**: An enigmatic group that operates along the Riverlands, their warriors blend into the mist, striking without warning before vanishing as if they were never there.  

#### **Political Machinations**  
In Khor’Dara, power is a fragile thing, and those who wield it must do so with cunning. Nobles, priest-kings, and rebel leaders alike engage in constant games of subterfuge:  
- **Poison** is the weapon of choice among Zhara’s merchant lords, their feasts as deadly as any battlefield. Cups are often tested by tasters, though not all poisons leave traces—or claim their victims immediately.  
- **Blackmail** fuels the intrigues of Lunhai, where even the most debauched noble fears the exposure of their darkest secrets. Courtesans, spies, and servants often wield influence far greater than their station, trading whispers for gold or favors.  
- **Assassination** is commonplace in Khemru, where necromancers use their arcane arts to send shadowy specters or venomous curses after their rivals. A sudden death is rarely questioned in a city where life and death are but tools of power.  

#### **Underground Networks**  
Beneath the gilded towers and festering streets of Khor’Dara’s cities lies a hidden world of smugglers, thieves, and cultists. These underground networks thrive on the chaos above, shaping the destinies of the continent in ways unseen.  
- **The Silk Veil**: A smugglers' syndicate that operates along Lunhai’s canals, their members recognizable by the translucent scarves they wear. They specialize in contraband like rare silks, narcotics, and cursed artifacts, often trading with rebel groups.  
- **The Shadow Guild**: Zhara’s premier thieves’ guild, their network extends into every corner of the city. From burglary to espionage, no crime is beyond their reach. They are rumored to answer to a single figure known only as **The Mask**, whose identity is fiercely protected.  
- **The Charnel Pact**: A cult operating in Khemru’s ruins, worshiping death itself as a deity. Their members desecrate burial sites to harvest relics and forbidden magics, often working as mercenaries or assassins for the necromancer-kings.  

### Mystic Forces

#### **Sorcery**  
Magic in Khor’Dara flows like an untamed river, its currents shaped by the land’s supernatural elements but always threatening to overflow its banks. Practicing sorcery is a perilous endeavor, for every spell carries a price—be it one’s sanity, life force, or something less tangible but equally vital. Sorcerers walk a thin line between reverence and fear, often revered as saviors while simultaneously shunned as harbingers of doom.  

- **Blood Magic**: The most feared and viscerally potent form of sorcery, blood magic draws power directly from life essence. Practitioners use their own blood—or, more commonly, that of others—to fuel their spells. The rituals are grisly, often involving sacrifices on altars engraved with runes that pulse with a sickly red glow. While immensely powerful, blood magic leaves a permanent mark on its wielder, manifesting in pale skin, cracked veins, or an aura of unease that makes animals and children shy away. Blood mages often become addicted to the potency of their craft, their humanity slowly eroded by their lust for power.

- **Ritual Sorcery**: Ritual sorcery demands time, precision, and rare components, but it allows practitioners to channel power far beyond their natural abilities. These rites often take place in sacred or cursed locations, where the boundaries between worlds are thin. Sorcerers may draw sigils in ash, chant incantations under eclipses, or harness the latent energy of ancient artifacts. The price for failure is high: botched rituals can summon unintended horrors, tear rifts in reality, or trap the caster’s soul in a liminal space where torment knows no end.

- **Wild Magic**: Wild magic is raw, untamed, and unpredictable, often springing up in regions where the natural order has been broken. These bursts of power are as likely to heal a wound as to turn the ground beneath one’s feet into molten glass. Travelers in regions like the Veil of Muon or the Abyssal Rift report experiencing wild magic as storms of radiant energy, sudden transformations, or strange voices whispering in unknown tongues. Those who attempt to harness it must do so at great risk, for wild magic answers only to itself.

#### **Magical Threats**  
Magic in Khor’Dara is as much a danger as it is a tool, and its misuse often gives rise to entities and phenomena that threaten mortal lives:  

- **Rogue Sorcerers**: These are practitioners who have been consumed by their own power, their minds shattered or their bodies warped into monstrous forms. Some wander aimlessly, leaving destruction in their wake, while others deliberately spread chaos, viewing it as a natural extension of their newfound nature.  
- **Spirit-Bonded Predators**: In regions like the Spine of Kharn or the Verdant Abyss, predators have been known to bond with elemental or otherworldly spirits. These creatures are faster, stronger, and more cunning than their mundane counterparts, making them nearly impossible to kill through conventional means.  
- **Cursed Zones**: Certain places, often marked by ancient tragedies or failed rituals, have become permanently warped by residual magic. In these zones, the rules of reality unravel: time loops endlessly, gravity pulls in unpredictable directions, and even death itself loses its permanence.  

#### **Supernatural Entities**  

- **The Forest King**: In the shadowy depths of the Verdant Abyss, the Forest King reigns as both protector and predator. Descriptions of this being vary—some say it is a towering figure with antlers that scrape the canopy, its eyes glowing with an unearthly light; others believe it is a spirit that takes many forms, from a great beast to a swarm of insects. The Forest King is said to punish those who exploit the jungle’s resources without reverence, often leaving their remains displayed as grim warnings. Worshiped by the Ironleaf Clans and feared by outsiders, the Forest King’s true nature remains a mystery, though its influence over the Verdant Abyss is undeniable.  

- **Stormcallers**: Dwelling in the Spine of Kharn, the Stormcallers are elemental spirits who embody the fury of the skies. They are believed to be remnants of ancient Titans, their voices echoing in thunder and their wrath manifesting in tempests. Shepherds and mountaineers leave offerings at cliffside shrines, hoping to placate the Stormcallers, while sorcerers and shamans occasionally risk summoning them for guidance or power. Summoning a Stormcaller, however, is fraught with peril, for their aid is as likely to destroy as to save.

#### **Forbidden Knowledge**  
The ruins of Khor’Dara hold secrets too dangerous to be freely known. Hidden within labyrinthine temples, crumbling ziggurats, and sunken archives are tomes, artifacts, and inscriptions that offer glimpses into the arcane. Yet this knowledge often demands a terrible price:  

- **Eldritch Tomes**: Books bound in human skin or etched into obsidian tablets contain spells, prophecies, and histories long forgotten. Reading these texts often induces madness, as the words twist and writhe on the page, seeming to speak directly into the reader’s mind.  
- **Artifacts of Power**: Items like the **Opal Mask** or the **Blood Chalice** grant immense abilities but corrupt their wielders, draining their life force or twisting their bodies. These relics are highly sought after by sorcerers and rulers alike, though few who obtain them survive unscathed.  
- **Enigmatic Cults**: Hidden sects dedicate their lives to guarding—or exploiting—this forbidden knowledge. Some act as caretakers, ensuring it remains buried, while others seek to unlock its full potential, no matter the cost.  

### Relics and Artifacts

#### **Ancient Weapons**

- **Obsidian Fang**: Forged in the volcanic depths beneath the Obsidian Spire of Zhara, this curved blade drinks the essence of those it slays, leaving their corpses pale and desiccated. The souls consumed by the Fang are said to linger within the blade, their whispers haunting the wielder’s dreams. Legends claim that the blade’s full power can only be unlocked through a ritual sacrifice atop Zhara’s fiery altars, binding the wielder to the sorcerer-priests. Those who wield the Obsidian Fang gain immense strength and speed in battle, but the blade’s hunger is insatiable, and its user risks becoming a prisoner of its dark will.

- **Spear of the Skycaller**: Said to be a gift from the storm gods, this spear crackles with latent electricity, its shaft carved from the bones of a fallen thunderbeast and its head crafted from meteoric iron. When hurled, the spear calls down lightning to smite its target, leaving scorched earth and shattered foes in its wake. Skycallers of the steppes revere the weapon as a sacred relic, wielded only by their most honored champions. However, the Spear exacts a toll: prolonged use weakens the wielder’s body, leaving them frail and scarred by the very storms they command.

#### **Cursed Treasures**

- **The Crown of Khemru**: A tarnished gold circlet adorned with blood-red gemstones, the Crown of Khemru once graced the brow of the necromancer-kings who ruled the Sunken Crown. It grants its wearer mastery over the undead, allowing them to summon and command legions of skeletal warriors. Yet the Crown binds its bearer’s soul to the necromancer-kings of old, who whisper their commands through dreams and visions. Over time, the wearer begins to lose their sense of self, their thoughts and will subsumed by the collective consciousness of the Crown's former rulers.

- **The Opal Mask**: This porcelain-white mask is inlaid with shimmering opals that catch the light in mesmerizing patterns. When worn, the mask grants its user glimpses of the future, from minor portents to grand visions of destiny. Yet these visions are fragmented and contradictory, driving the wearer to madness as they attempt to reconcile them. Those who have worn the mask for too long speak in riddles, their minds fractured by an eternity of potential outcomes. The mask is believed to have been crafted by an elder race, and some say it holds the key to their lost civilization—if one can decipher its cryptic insights.

#### **Magical Implements**

- **Starshards**: Iridescent crystals that hum faintly with arcane energy, Starshards are fragments of a meteor said to have fallen during Khor’Dara’s earliest epoch. They amplify sorcery, allowing even novice practitioners to wield immense power. However, their use comes at a steep cost: prolonged exposure drains the vitality of their wielder, causing physical decay and, eventually, death. The shards glow brighter as their user approaches their end, a hauntingly beautiful reminder of the price of ambition.

- **Blood Chalice**: A goblet carved from bone and encrusted with rubies, the Blood Chalice magnifies blood magic rituals, allowing sorcerers to enact feats of incredible power. It is said that the Chalice contains the essence of a forgotten god, whose thirst for sacrifice drives its user to madness. Lands where the Chalice has been used are left barren and cursed, with twisted flora and hostile spirits haunting the desolate ruins. Despite its dangers, many covet the Chalice, seeing it as the ultimate tool to tip the scales of war or reshape reality itself.

#### **Remnants of Lost Civilizations**  
Scattered across Khor’Dara are the echoes of civilizations that predate even the gods. Their ruins are filled with relics whose purposes remain a mystery, often guarded by ancient traps and custodians.

- **Ziggurat of the Veiled Star**: This crumbling temple houses an artifact known as the **Luminarch**, a golden orb that radiates light capable of banishing even the darkest sorcery. The orb, however, can only be wielded by those who pass the trials of the temple, which test both strength and virtue.  
- **Hollow Guardians**: Towering statues of stone and bronze that stand vigil over ancient labyrinths, these automatons awaken when intruders draw near. Their origins are unknown, but they are thought to be constructs of an elder race that sought to preserve its secrets for eternity.  
- **The Glyph-Laden Doors**: Massive stone gates etched with glowing runes are said to block access to the heart of the Abyssal Rift. Scholars theorize that opening them would unleash a power capable of reshaping the continent—or destroying it.

#### **Dangerous Supernatural Objects**

- **The Shard of the Black Sun**: A jagged sliver of obsidian said to have fallen from a celestial eclipse, this shard radiates a malevolent energy that warps the minds and bodies of those who come into contact with it. The shard’s power is undeniable—it can amplify the strength of its bearer and imbue them with supernatural abilities. Yet, the price is steep: prolonged exposure transforms the wielder into a monstrous abomination, consumed by the shard’s darkness.

- **Echo Stone**: A smooth, silver-gray stone that captures and stores sounds, allowing its wielder to replay voices, chants, or even battle cries at will. While seemingly innocuous, the Echo Stone can also trap the voices of the dead, unleashing them as a cacophony that drives listeners to madness. It is said that breaking the stone releases the spirits within, granting them vengeance upon those who wronged them in life.

- **The Eye of Muon**: A glowing crystal orb that seems to shift between colors depending on who gazes into it. The Eye grants visions of other places and times but leaves its user vulnerable to being seen in return by entities from beyond. Those who use the Eye too often report strange occurrences: shadows that linger too long, whispers in languages they do not know, and an overwhelming sense of being watched.

### Legends and Whispers

#### **Origin Myths**  
The creation of Khor’Dara is a tale cloaked in awe and fear, with variations shaped by the beliefs of different tribes and city-states:  

- **The Fallen Titan**: It is said that Khor’Dara rose from the corpse of a great titan, slain by the gods in a battle that shook the heavens. The titan’s immense body formed the mountains and valleys, its breath gave rise to the winds, and its blood seeped into the earth, creating the rivers and fueling the land’s potent sorcery. The titan’s spirit lingers still, its wrath manifesting in the land’s violent storms, earthquakes, and eruptions. Some whisper that the titan’s heart still beats, buried deep within the Abyssal Rift, and that one day it will rise again to reclaim the world.

- **The Hollow Earth Exile**: Another myth speaks of the gods' punishment upon the people of Khor’Dara, whose hubris led them to defy divine will. For their arrogance, the gods banished the continent, sinking it beneath the surface and shrouding it in an eternal veil of mystery. According to this tale, the gods severed Khor’Dara from the heavens, leaving its inhabitants to wander in shadow and despair. Priests in the Obsidian Spire claim that the gods’ gaze still pierces the earth, and only through devotion and sacrifice can the continent be restored to its rightful place under the sun.

#### **Heroic Narratives**  
The exploits of lone warriors and cunning champions resonate through the history of Khor’Dara, their deeds becoming the backbone of songs, epics, and whispered tales:  

- **The Scourge of Khemru**: Long ago, a warrior known only as **Kael the Unyielding** stormed the swamp city of Khemru, seeking vengeance for the death of his family. Armed with the **Spear of the Skycaller**, Kael defied the necromancer-kings, cleaving through legions of undead and shattering the enchanted chains that bound the city’s slaves. His final battle took place atop the Grand Ziggurat, where he struck down the last necromancer-king before succumbing to his wounds. Though he perished, his deeds are immortalized in the songs of the free folk, and the Spear is said to remain hidden somewhere within the ruins of Khemru.

- **The Beast-Tamer of the Steppes**: The Skycallers tell of **Ashira Windrider**, a shaman who rode a thunderbeast into battle during an invasion of the Wailing Steppes. Armed with bone-crafted weapons and the blessings of the winds, she united the scattered tribes to repel the invaders. Ashira’s bond with the thunderbeast became legendary, and it is said that when she died, her spirit merged with the winds, forever guarding her people from harm.

- **The Betrayer’s Redemption**: Among the Ironleaf Clans, the story of **Jorin the Oathbreaker** is told as both cautionary tale and inspiration. Banished for betraying his kin to a rival clan, Jorin wandered the Weeping Forest, hunted by spirits and beasts. In his exile, he discovered the ruined temple of an elder race, where he forged a pact with the **Forest King**. With the Forest King’s guidance, Jorin redeemed himself by leading his people to victory against an encroaching army, though it is said he paid a terrible price, forever bound to the forest’s will.

#### **Dark Prophecies**  
The shamans of Khor’Dara speak of a foreboding event known as the **Eclipse of Khor’Dara**, a time when the barriers between worlds will shatter, plunging the land into chaos:  

- **The Eclipse of Khor’Dara**: According to ancient texts and oral traditions, the eclipse will begin when the moon and sun align above the Abyssal Rift, casting the continent into shadow. During this time, it is said that horrors from beyond the veil will spill into the mortal realm, driven by the titan’s stirring heart. The Forest King’s antlered form will darken the skies, the Stormcallers will rage unchecked, and the necromancer-kings will rise from their graves to reclaim their dominion. Prophecies differ on how the eclipse can be stopped—some claim the **Luminarch** must be retrieved from the Ziggurat of the Veiled Star, while others say a chosen warrior must sever the titan’s heart before it awakens.  

- **The Veil of Blood**: Another prophecy, whispered by the priests of Zhara, speaks of a future when the Obsidian Fang will drink so deeply of souls that it will tear open a gateway to a realm of endless fire. This event, known as the Veil of Blood, will herald the end of all mortal life, leaving Khor’Dara as a charred wasteland. The priests claim only their rites can prevent this apocalypse, though skeptics argue they may be hastening its arrival.

#### **Oral Traditions**  
The tribes and city-states of Khor’Dara each preserve their histories and warnings through oral traditions, weaving truths and myths into a tapestry of shared memory:  

- **Songs of the Steppes**: The Skycallers pass down their history through song, each melody carried on the winds. These ballads recount great hunts, battles, and alliances, often changing subtly with each generation. Many of these songs contain hidden warnings about the land’s dangers, from storms that speak to cursed springs that lure the unwary.

- **The Tales of Khemru**: The Children of Khemru weave their traditions into elaborate funerary rites, where the deeds of the dead are recited in chants as their bodies are offered to the swamp. These chants often hint at buried relics and hidden power, guarded by curses only the most daring or foolish would dare to challenge.

- **Whispers of the Forest**: Among the Ironleaf Clans, elders share tales by firelight, their voices low to avoid attracting unwanted attention. These stories often blur the line between myth and caution, warning of travelers who defied the Forest King or dared to disturb the ruins of the elder race. Many such stories end abruptly, leaving the fate of their protagonists to the imagination—a deliberate choice meant to instill fear and humility.

- **Legends of the Rift**: Those who have dared to explore the Abyssal Rift bring back fragmented tales of glowing spires, voices in the dark, and visions of otherworldly cities. These stories are passed from traveler to traveler, their details mutating with each retelling. Some dismiss them as exaggerations, but others believe they contain clues to the Rift’s secrets and the lost civilization that once thrived there.
