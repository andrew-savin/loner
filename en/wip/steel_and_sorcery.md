Here’s the template filled in with the sword and sorcery setting as per your instructions. I’ve added detailed descriptions and tables to match the theme.

# Steel and Sorcery

***Steel and Sorcery*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a dark, gritty world where ancient ruins, corrupt cities, and wild frontiers are the backdrop for tales of survival, revenge, and treasure-hunting. The setting is steeped in mythological inspiration, drawing from pseudo-medieval and ancient cultures, where magic is rare, dangerous, and often feared.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be fast-paced, focusing on intense action, personal stakes, and morally ambiguous heroes who navigate a world of danger and mystery.

## Introduction

*Steel and Sorcery* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Steel and Sorcery** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *"Wary Adventurer"*, *"Cursed Blade"*, or *"Scarred Veteran"*.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Steel and Sorcery* you will need:
- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Steel and Sorcery* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind." But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

*Steel and Sorcery* immerses you in a world where the past weighs heavily, and every shadow might hide a deadly threat. The setting is a blend of ancient ruins, dense forests, and desolate wastelands, where once-great civilizations have crumbled into obscurity, leaving behind cursed artifacts and forgotten lore.

The world is a dangerous place, ruled by tyrants, haunted by ancient evils, and stalked by vicious beasts. Magic exists, but it is the domain of dark sorcerers, corrupt priests, and other nefarious beings. Most common folk view it with suspicion or outright fear, and those who wield it are often met with hostility.

### Playable Themes

- **Survival**: Every day is a struggle against the harsh environment, dangerous beasts, and treacherous enemies.
- **Revenge**: A personal vendetta drives the hero, with enemies lurking at every corner.
- **Treasure Hunting**: Delve into forgotten ruins and ancient tombs in search of wealth and powerful artifacts.
- **Morality**: Navigate a world where right and wrong are blurred, and choices often have dire consequences.
- **Exploration**: Discover hidden places and ancient secrets, revealing the dark history of the world.

### Timeline

- **The Age of Heroes**: A time long past when great warriors and kings ruled the land, now remembered only in myths and legends.
- **The Fall of Empires**: Civilizations rose and fell, leaving behind ruins and relics of their former glory.
- **The Dark Age**: The present era, a time of decay, corruption, and fear, where only the strong survive.

## Characters

*Steel and Sorcery* is centered around the exploits of lone heroes or anti-heroes—warriors, rogues, and survivors—each with their own motivations, skills, and weaknesses. These characters are often morally ambiguous, driven by personal codes of honor, revenge, or simple survival.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Steel and Sorcery*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Cunning Mercenary"* or *"Haunted Gladiator"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Stealthy"* is not a skill, *"Shadow Stalker"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult.
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

### Character Traits

## Rules

*Steel and Sorcery* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Steel and Sorcery* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Steel and Sorcery* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, but...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tags cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Setting Related Rules

1. **Mysterious Magic**: Magic is rare and dangerous. Whenever you encounter magic, roll 1d6. On a 1 or 2, it works as intended. On a 3 or 4, it has unintended side effects. On a 5 or 6, something goes horribly wrong.
2. **Corruption**: Exposure to dark forces or sorcery can lead to corruption. Each time your character uses or is affected by magic, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, gain a *Corruption* tag that reflects a physical, mental, or spiritual degradation.
3. **Gritty Combat**: Whenever you are wounded, roll 1d6. On a 1-3, the wound is minor. On a 4-6, it’s serious, reducing your Luck by 1 permanently until it can be treated.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Exploring the World [if feasible with the setting]

Steel and Sorcery takes place in a world full of unexplored territories, ancient ruins, and treacherous landscapes. Exploration is essential, as it leads to discoveries of lost treasures, hidden dangers, and forgotten knowledge.

### Preparation

* **Define Your Destination:**  Choose a specific location on your map (hand-drawn or provided) or have the Oracle (dice rolls) determine a general direction and a rumor about a point of interest.
* **Choose Your Mode of Travel:** Consider your character's skills, resources, and the desired speed of travel.
* **Stock Up:**  Gather supplies based on your chosen travel time and potential hazards. 

### The Journey

#### A. [Vehicle Type] Exploration

* **Navigation Check:** Roll a d6 to navigate. On a 4+, navigate successfully. On a 3 or less, consult the "[Vehicle Type] Encounters" table for a random encounter or complication.
* **Weather Check:** Every d6 hours roll a d6. On a 1 or 2, encounter rough weather (strong winds, lightning storms) that may damage your [Vehicle Type] (apply a relevant trait to the [Vehicle Type]).
* **Scouting Check (optional):** Attempt to scout the landing area. Before landing in an unexplored area, roll a d6. On a 4+, gain a brief glimpse of the surrounding terrain and potential dangers. On a 3 or less, you miss crucial details.

#### Reaching Your Destination

Upon reaching your destination, consult your map or the Oracle for details about the location and potential encounters.  This could be a bustling city, a forgotten ruin, a hidden valley inhabited by strange creatures, or anything your imagination conjures. Use your character's skills and the exploration mechanics to overcome challenges, gather information, and uncover the secrets of Steel and Sorcery.

### **The Shrouded Continent of Khor’Dara**

Khor’Dara is a mythical lost continent, shrouded in legend and mystery, located beyond the known seas of the ancient world—or perhaps beneath it, nestled in the Hollow Earth. It exists in a timeless epoch where primeval forces rule as much as men and gods. Khor’Dara is a land of stark contrasts: untamed wilderness, decadent city-states, and borderlands that defy the grip of civilization. Magic lingers as an unpredictable, corrupting force, feared and revered in equal measure.

Khor’Dara borrows from the **Bronze Age Near East, Mesopotamia**, and **pre-classical Mediterranean cultures**, blending them into a unique tapestry:  
- **Architecture**: Ziggurats, hanging gardens, obsidian fortresses, and labyrinthine palaces.  
- **Religion**: Polytheistic pantheons filled with flawed, capricious gods. Priests hold immense political power, while cults thrive on the outskirts of cities.  
- **Technology**: Bronze weapons, chariots, and massive stone constructions. Civilization is fragile, often crumbling back into barbarism after disasters.  
- **Society**: Stark class divisions, with rulers claiming divine descent, a merchant class wielding influence, and slaves or outcasts forming the base of the hierarchy.  

---

### **Themes**
- **Survival vs. Civilization**: Heroes often find themselves caught between the harshness of the wilderness and the decadence of urban centers.  
- **Ambition and Hubris**: Many civilizations and individuals fall victim to their desire for power, whether through sorcery, conquest, or defiance of natural laws.  
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Characters must navigate a world where good and evil are often relative, and survival may come at a great cost.  
- **Mystery and Wonder**: The supernatural elements of Khor’Dara are never fully explained, leaving room for awe and terror.  

---

### **Lands of Conflict**
- **Geographical Regions**:  
  - **The Wailing Steppes**: Vast plains where nomadic tribes hunt megafauna and endure winds said to carry the voices of forgotten spirits.  
  - **The Spine of Kharn**: Treacherous mountains filled with hidden caves, monstrous predators, and ancient ruins guarded by stone-skinned sentinels.  
  - **The Verdant Abyss**: A jungle alive with colossal predators and venomous flora, concealing crumbled temples of an elder race.  
  - **The Scorched Wastes**: Once a fertile heartland, now a cracked desert haunted by fire-spirits and deadly mirages.  
  - **The Riverlands of Nurim**: A sprawling delta where civilization frays at the edges. Freebooters, exiled nobles, and rogue shamans ply the waters, contending with crocodilian beasts and ancient river spirits.  
  - **The Cloud Marches**: A highland frontier where nomadic clans and settlers clash over grazing lands. Here, the skies teem with monstrous birds of prey and storms laced with supernatural energies.  
  - **The Weeping Forest**: A frontier known for its towering trees and eerie quiet. Settlers speak of strange lights at night and whisper of a shadowy figure known only as the "Forest King."  

- **Supernatural Landscapes**:  
  - **The Veil of Muon**: A shimmering, shifting desert where the boundaries between time and space collapse. Explorers here risk encountering their own ghosts or walking into the past—or future.  
  - **The Singing Peaks**: Mountains that hum with an otherworldly resonance. Supposedly the burial place of the Titans, their presence lingers in the form of storms and earthquakes.  
  - **The Abyssal Rift**: A vast chasm at the continent’s heart, filled with glowing fungal forests and strange, predatory creatures. At its depths lie the remnants of a civilization predating even the gods.  

---

### **Tribes and Survivors**
- **Dominant Cultures**:  
  - **Skycallers of the Steppes**: Nomadic people who revere the winds and hunt with bone-crafted weapons. Their shamans claim to speak to ancestors carried by the gales.  
  - **Children of Khemru**: A swamp-dwelling society ruled by necromancer-kings who enforce their will with undead servitors.  
  - **Ironleaf Clans**: Fierce forest dwellers who craft weapons from enchanted wood and speak of a "Forest King" who guides their hunts.  
- **Social Structures**:  
  Tribal societies are clan-based, with leadership often claimed by strength or spiritual favor. In city-states, rigid hierarchies dominate, with nobles and priest-kings at the top.  
- **Survival Hierarchies**:  
  Each tribe or settlement is defined by what it values most—strength, cunning, or divine favor. Those who fail to contribute to survival are often cast out.  
- **Warrior Traditions**:  
  Khor’Dara’s warriors are brutal and pragmatic, excelling in guerrilla tactics, mounted combat, and ambushes. Ritualized duels often decide leadership or settle disputes.  

---

### **Powers and Intrigues**
- **Rival City-States**:  
  - **The Obsidian Spire of Zhara**: Built atop a volcano, this city-state thrives on trade and blood magic. Its ruling sorcerer-priests extract power from rituals of sacrifice, controlling an empire of slaves and merchants. Intrigue, betrayal, and poison thrive in its shadowed halls.  
  - **Lunhai, the Pearl City**: Perched along the shore of an inland sea, Lunhai is a city of wealth and decay. Its canals run thick with opium and wine, and its nobles grow fat on the labor of the destitute. Beneath its glittering veneer lie cults devoted to a drowned god.  
  - **Khemru, the Sunken Crown**: Half-submerged in the swamps, this city is ruled by necromancer-kings who prolong their lives with dark sorcery. Its stinking alleys are patrolled by undead servitors, and its temples are gilded in both gold and despair.  

- **Mercenary Alliances**:  
  The frontier teems with mercenary bands willing to fight for gold, land, or artifacts. These groups often play a pivotal role in conflicts between city-states.  
- **Political Machinations**:  
  Nobles, priest-kings, and rebel factions all scheme to undermine their rivals. Poison, blackmail, and assassination are tools of the ambitious.  
- **Underground Networks**:  
  Smugglers, thieves, and secret cults thrive in the shadows of cities. These factions are often tied to forgotten gods or magical contraband, shaping the balance of power.  

---

### **Mystic Forces**
- **Sorcery**:  
  Magic in Khor’Dara is deeply tied to the land’s supernatural elements. It is chaotic, dangerous, and never fully understood. Sorcery often exacts a price—sanity, life force, or worse—and its practitioners are as feared as they are respected.  
  - **Blood Magic**: Drawing power from life essence, often through gruesome sacrifices.  
  - **Ritual Sorcery**: Complex rites tied to ancient artifacts or ley lines, requiring rare components and risky incantations.  
  - **Wild Magic**: Unpredictable bursts of power found in supernatural regions, feared for its chaotic effects.  

- **Magical Threats**:  
  Rogue sorcerers, spirit-bonded predators, and cursed zones where reality warps pose existential risks.  

- **Supernatural Entities**:  
  - **The Forest King**: A shadowy figure said to rule the Verdant Abyss, worshiped by some and feared by all.  
  - **Stormcallers**: Elemental spirits said to reside in the Spine of Kharn, capable of summoning deadly tempests.  

- **Forbidden Knowledge**:  
  Hidden in ancient ruins or guarded by enigmatic cults, this knowledge offers great power but often at the cost of one’s humanity—or soul.  

---

### **Relics and Artifacts**
- **Ancient Weapons**:  
  - **Obsidian Fang**: A blade said to consume the souls of its victims, forged in the fires beneath Zhara.  
  - **Spear of the Skycaller**: A lightning-infused weapon wielded by steppes warriors, said to be a gift from the storm gods.  

- **Cursed Treasures**:  
  - **The Crown of Khemru**: Grants immense power but binds the wearer’s soul to the necromancer-kings of old.  
  - **The Opal Mask**: Allows its wearer to see the future—but drives them mad with fragmented visions.  

- **Magical Implements**:  
  - **Starshards**: Crystalline relics that enhance sorcery but degrade the user’s body over time.  
  - **Blood Chalice**: A vessel that amplifies blood magic rituals, leaving behind cursed lands wherever it’s used.  

- **Remnants of Lost Civilizations**:  
  Ruined ziggurats, labyrinthine temples, and hollow statues house relics of elder races, guarded by traps and forgotten guardians.  

- **Dangerous Supernatural Objects**:  
  Many artifacts are unstable, their powers often turning on those who attempt to wield them.  

---

### **Legends and Whispers**
- **Origin Myths**:

  
  - Khor’Dara was said to be born from the death of a great titan, whose body became the land and whose blood fuels its sorcery.  
  - The gods banished the continent from the surface world for the hubris of its people, hiding it within the Hollow Earth.  

- **Heroic Narratives**:  
  Stories of lone warriors slaying elder beasts, dethroning corrupt kings, or reclaiming lost relics inspire the downtrodden.  

- **Dark Prophecies**:  
  The shamans speak of the "Eclipse of Khor’Dara," a time when the boundaries between worlds will collapse, unleashing horrors upon the land.  

- **Oral Traditions**:  
  Tales are passed down through song and storytelling, each tribe or kingdom weaving its own version of the truth. These stories often hint at real treasures or dangers hidden in the wilderness.
