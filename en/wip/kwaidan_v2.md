# Loner: Kwaidan!  
*A Solo RPG of Ghosts, Yokai, and Folklore in Feudal Japan*

2nd Edition

***Loner: Kwaidan*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in **feudal Japan**, where the supernatural is ever-present, and spirits, yokai, and curses lurk in the shadows of everyday life. Inspired by traditional *kwaidan* (怪談, "strange tales"), this game immerses you in eerie folklore, exploring the thin veil between the living and the dead.  

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to tell **haunting, atmospheric stories** where wandering exorcists, cursed warriors, and lost souls navigate a world steeped in mystery, horror, and karmic fate.  

## Introduction  

*Loner: Kwaidan* follows the following design principles:  

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common six-sided dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.  
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few simple mechanics, easy to learn and eventually memorize.  
3. **Tag-based**: Characters, creatures, and locations are defined through qualitative descriptors (*tags*) rather than numbers.  

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Kwaidan** plunges you into a world of **haunted villages, vengeful spirits, and ancient folklore**. Your character will be defined by thematic tags such as *"Cursed Ronin,"* *"Wandering Onmyoji,"* or *"Haunted Merchant."*

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

## **What is Kwaidan?**  

The word *Kwaidan* (怪談) means "strange tales"—a tradition of **ghost stories, myths, and folklore** deeply rooted in Japanese culture. These stories blend history with supernatural horror, where spirits and creatures reflect the **fears, regrets, and karmic consequences** of the past.

In this game, you will:  
- **Face restless spirits** who seek revenge, justice, or closure.  
- **Survive encounters with yokai**—tricksters, beasts, or forgotten deities.  
- **Navigate feudal society**, where status, duty, and honor dictate fate.  
- **Explore eerie landscapes**—misty forests, ruined temples, and haunted roads.  
- **Unravel mysteries and curses** through folklore and intuition.  

Unlike high-action samurai epics, *Kwaidan* is about **atmosphere, tension, and the thin veil between the living and the dead**.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *[Product Name]* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *[Product Name]* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## **Setting Introduction**  

Feudal Japan is a land **divided by war and united by superstition**. The setting of *Loner: Kwaidan* takes place in an **alternate version of this historical period**, where the supernatural is not just a belief—it is real. Spirits, yokai, and ghosts wander the land, bound by the karmic cycles of life, death, and revenge.  

The world is both beautiful and perilous, where duty, honor, and fear shape the fate of individuals and entire villages. You will explore **forgotten shrines, mist-laden forests, and cursed battlefields**, encountering beings from the unseen world and uncovering ancient secrets.

### **Core Setting Features**  

- **Feudal Japan Amidst Conflict**  
  - Warring clans fight for dominance, while **outlaws, exorcists, and masterless samurai** wander the land.  
  - The **Shogun’s rule is unstable**, and local lords (daimyo) struggle to maintain power.  
  - Hidden sects, shadowy onmyoji (court sorcerers), and secretive ninja clans all play their parts in the grand struggle for control.  

- **A World Between the Living and the Dead**  
  - The border between **the physical world and the spirit realm (Yomi)** is thin.  
  - Ghosts (*yūrei*) walk among the living, bound by **regret, vengeance, or unfinished duties**.  
  - Ancient yokai—some mischievous, others monstrous—lurk in the wilderness, interfering in human affairs.  

- **Villages, Temples, and Haunted Roads**  
  - Small settlements live in fear of **strange occurrences, unexplained disappearances, and cursed objects**.

- **Superstitions and Forbidden Knowledge**  
  - The people **follow omens, ward off evil with charms, and respect sacred places**.

- **The Price of Honor and Dishonor**  
  - Bushido binds samurai to **codes of duty and sacrifice**, but not all follow the path of righteousness.  
  - A single act of dishonor may bring **spiritual curses, divine wrath, or exile**.  
  - A wandering ronin, an outcast priest, or a disgraced noble **may find redemption—or fall deeper into darkness**.

### **Timeline of the Setting**  

This world is shaped by centuries of conflict, belief, and forgotten history. The past haunts the present—sometimes **literally**.  

- **The Age of Spirits (Long Ago – Ancient Times)**  
  - Before men ruled, **kami, yokai, and spirits shaped the land**.  
  - Humans learned **rituals, exorcisms, and wards** to coexist with the supernatural.

  - Warlords (daimyo) establish domains, enforcing **law and order with steel**.  
  - Onmyoji become **political advisors**, using supernatural knowledge to influence courts.  
  - Ghosts of slain warriors **linger on battlefields**, unwilling to accept death.

  - The power of the daimyo is **crumbling**, and war threatens stability.  
  - More villages suffer from **unrest, disappearances, and hauntings**.  
  - Some **seek peace with spirits**, while others **exploit them for power**.  

- **The Dark Times (A Future Unwritten)**  
  - If balance is not maintained, **chaos will consume the land**.  
  - Will the spirits of the dead be laid to rest—or will they drown the world in darkness?  

## Characters  

In *Loner: Kwaidan*, you step into the shoes of **wandering souls**, caught between the worlds of the **living and the dead**. You may be a **disgraced samurai seeking redemption**, an **exorcist hunting vengeful spirits**, or a **cursed villager unraveling the fate that binds them**.  

Each character carries **burdens, skills, and secrets**—but in a world where **yokai, ghosts, and curses are real**, no one is truly safe. Some may find **peace, power, or understanding**, while others risk **falling into darkness, becoming spirits themselves**.  

Your journey will be one of **mystery, horror, and fate**, where each step brings you **closer to the unknown**. Will you break free from your past, or will your story become another whispered legend?

## Rules

*[Product Name]* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *[Product Name]* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *[Product Name]* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Chi, Corruption, and Honor 

In *Loner: Kwaidan*, the world operates under **spiritual laws** just as much as physical ones. Fate is unpredictable, the supernatural is ever-present, and characters are bound by unseen forces—whether they be **karma, spirits, or the weight of dishonor**.  

The game uses a **Luck-like system** to track three **core spiritual and personal attributes** that shape a character’s journey:  

- **Chi (Energy & Balance)** – The flow of personal energy, used to fuel supernatural abilities and resist dark forces.  
- **Corruption (Moral & Spiritual Decay)** – The slow descent into darkness from exposure to evil, curses, and forbidden magic.  
- **Honor (Reputation & Spiritual Integrity)** – The character’s social and moral standing, dictating how others perceive them.  

Each of these starts **at 6** and can fluctuate based on actions and choices. When one reaches 0, **the character undergoes a major transformation**, for better or worse.  

#### Using the Oracle  

When a scene involves **spiritual forces, honor-bound decisions, or the effects of corruption**, the Oracle helps determine the outcome:  

| **Dice Roll** | **Chi Check (Energy & Power)** | **Corruption Check (Moral Decay)** | **Honor Check (Reputation & Integrity)** |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Yes, and...** | Your power flows effortlessly. Regain 1 Chi. | You resist the darkness completely. Reduce Corruption. | You are honored beyond expectation. Gain Honor. |
| **Yes...** | Your power works as expected. No cost. | You hold firm against evil. No effect. | Your reputation holds steady. No change. |
| **Yes, but...** | You succeed but at a cost. Lose 1 Chi. | You are tainted but remain in control. Gain 1 Corruption. | You uphold your honor but suffer suspicion or doubt. |
| **No, but...** | You fail, but something mitigates the loss. Lose 1 Chi, but gain insight. | You commit a dark act, but a moment of clarity tempers it. | You make a dishonorable choice but hide it well. |
| **No...** | Your power fails. Lose 2 Chi. | Darkness takes hold. Gain 2 Corruption. | Your honor is questioned. Lose 2 Honor. |
| **No, and...** | The supernatural backfires terribly. Lose 3 Chi. | Corruption consumes you. Gain 3 Corruption. | You are disgraced beyond redemption. Lose 3 Honor. |

#### Chi: The Flow of Energy & Power  

Chi (**気**, "vital energy") represents **inner balance, resilience, and supernatural power**. Those trained in the ways of the **onmyoji, monks, and yokai hunters** can channel it into **exorcisms, spells, and sacred arts**, while warriors use it for feats of physical prowess.  

- **Spending Chi:**  
  - Using supernatural abilities costs **1 Chi** per use.  
  - Exorcisms, spiritual combat, and blessing objects require a **Chi check**.  
  - Martial characters can spend **Chi to push their limits** (e.g., a second attack, resisting pain, enhanced reflexes).  

- **Recovering Chi:**  
  - **Meditation, rituals, and sacred rest** restore **1d6 Chi** per session.  
  - Drinking sacred water, resting in temples, or connecting with spirits can **regain Chi**, pending an **Oracle check**.  
  - A character at **0 Chi is spiritually exhausted**, unable to use abilities until they **properly rest or receive divine aid**.  

---

#### Corruption: The Pull of Darkness  

In a world filled with **vengeful ghosts, curses, and forbidden magic**, corruption is an ever-present danger. **The more one interacts with evil, the more it clings to the soul.**  

- **Gaining Corruption:**  
  - **Using dark magic** (blood rites, yokai bargaining, necromancy)  
  - **Exposure to cursed places** (haunted battlefields, defiled shrines)  
  - **Witnessing or committing atrocities** (massacres, dishonorable killings)  
  - **Being possessed, bitten, or wounded by supernatural forces**  

- **Resisting Corruption (Oracle Check Required):**  
  - Successfully exorcising a spirit (**Yes, and...** result may cleanse Corruption).  
  - Performing **acts of devotion**, such as lighting incense at a shrine.  
  - **Avoiding temptation** (e.g., refusing a demon’s offer).  
  - Gaining **spiritual protection** from monks, priests, or sacred artifacts.  

- **Corruption at 0 → Transformation:**  
  - If a character's **Corruption reaches 6**, they become **tainted**. Their **aura changes, attracting yokai and fearful stares**.  
  - At **8 or higher**, they risk **becoming a monster**, their soul slipping beyond human redemption.  
  - At **10+, they are lost**—either turning into a vengeful ghost, a cursed warrior, or a yokai themselves.  

Corruption can be mitigated, but **never fully erased**—what has been touched by darkness always leaves a stain.

#### Honor: Reputation & Spiritual Integrity  

Honor is more than just reputation—it is **a measure of personal virtue, dignity, and adherence to the Bushido code** (or a moral equivalent for monks and commoners).  

Losing Honor does not mean losing *power*, but it **changes how the world treats you**. A **dishonored samurai** becomes a **ronin**, a disgraced monk **loses divine favor**, and a fallen noble may become **a ghost in the making**.  

- **Losing Honor:**  
  - Breaking an oath, lying, or betraying a trust  
  - Dishonoring a fallen foe (e.g., looting a samurai’s corpse)  
  - Killing an unarmed opponent, or harming an innocent  
  - Failing to uphold a duty or **abandoning a sworn cause**  

- **Regaining Honor:**  
  - **Atoning for past misdeeds** (acts of mercy, sacrifice, or oaths of service)  
  - Defeating an opponent in **honorable combat**  
  - Protecting the weak or standing against corruption  
  - Performing **ritual cleansing**, **pilgrimages**, or seeking guidance from elders  

- **Honor at 0 → Social & Spiritual Fallout:**  
  - Samurai at **0 Honor become outcasts**—unable to claim hospitality, losing all privileges.  
  - Peasants at **0 Honor are cursed**, believed to be spiritually impure.  
  - Monks at **0 Honor are forsaken**, unable to call upon divine blessings.  
  - **A character whose Honor drops below 0 may become a vengeful ghost upon death.**  

---

### When Traits Interact  

Certain **critical moments** involve **multiple attributes**, where Chi, Corruption, and Honor all influence the same event.  

#### **1. Fighting a Demon (Chi vs. Corruption vs. Honor)**  
- If the **Chi check fails**, the **demon overpowers you**.  
- If the **Corruption check fails**, its presence leaves a mark on you.  
- If the **Honor check fails**, you resort to dishonorable means to win, staining your reputation.  

#### **2. Breaking a Curse (Chi vs. Honor vs. Oracle)**  
- If you lack **Chi**, you cannot perform the ritual.  
- If your **Honor is too low**, the gods may ignore your prayers.  
- If the Oracle roll is **"No, and..."**, the curse **latches onto you instead**.  

#### **3. Bargaining with a Ghost (Honor vs. Corruption vs. Oracle)**  
- **Honor dictates how the ghost treats you.**  
- **Corruption affects whether it trusts you or sees you as kin.**  
- **A successful Oracle roll means it may rest in peace.**  

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## **Setting Information**  

The world of *Loner: Kwaidan* is a reflection of **feudal Japan, infused with the supernatural**. It is a place where **ancient shrines hold forgotten spirits, battlefields echo with the cries of lingering ghosts, and yokai walk among humans in disguise**.  

This is not the Japan of history books, but rather a **mythic and haunted landscape**, where superstition and folklore are **indistinguishable from reality**. Every village, mountain, and river carries its own story—some filled with wisdom, others with warnings.  

---

### **Geography: A Haunted Land**  

The geography of *Kwaidan* is shaped by **both nature and the supernatural**, where the landscape itself **holds memories of past tragedies and hidden forces**.  

- **Mountain Shrines & Hidden Paths** – The highlands are home to ancient temples, many abandoned and overgrown. Some are still watched over by **mysterious monks, fox spirits, or cursed guardians**.  
- **Dark Forests & Cursed Groves** – Ancient trees whisper with the voices of lost travelers. Some forests shift **when no one is looking**, while others hide **forgotten villages where the living and dead coexist**.  
- **Isolated Fishing Villages & Ghostly Shores** – Coastal towns rely on the sea, but **not all drowned souls rest peacefully**. Sailors speak of **umibozu** rising from the waves and **lantern boats drifting without crew**.  
- **The Ruins of War** – The bones of long-forgotten battles litter the land. Ghosts of fallen warriors **reenact their last moments**, forever seeking an end to their struggles.  
- **The Spirit Roads** – Roads that do not always lead where they should. A traveler may set out for one place and find themselves **somewhere else entirely—sometimes, in a time long past**.  

---

### **Cultures & People**  

The people of this world live in a **constant state of fear, reverence, and acceptance of the supernatural**. Villages, towns, and courts are all shaped by **a belief in fate, omens, and spirits**.  

### **Social Structure**  
Feudal society is strict, but the influence of spirits, curses, and omens can **upset even the highest lords**.  

- **Samurai (武士, Bushi)** – Warriors bound by **duty, loyalty, and ritual**. They may be noble retainers or disgraced ronin **wandering in exile**.  
- **Peasants (農民, Nōmin)** – Farmers, fishermen, and laborers who **respect old traditions and fear the unseen**. They leave offerings at roadside shrines and avoid places where **the dead are restless**.  
- **Monks & Onmyoji (僧侶, 陰陽師)** – The spiritual keepers of the land, trained in **prayers, exorcisms, and sealing rituals**. Some hold power in courts, while others **live as wandering mystics, chasing ghosts and yokai**.  
- **Merchants & Artisans** – Traders who carry **both goods and rumors** from town to town. Some unknowingly transport **cursed objects**, while others **sell talismans that may—or may not—work**.  
- **Outcasts & Hidden Folk** – Bandits, wanderers, and those touched by **forbidden knowledge**. Some are **shapeshifters in disguise**, while others are simply **those whom society has cast aside**.  

#### **Everyday Beliefs**  
Life is dictated by **customs, taboos, and signs** that must not be ignored:  

- Never **whistle at night**—it calls the dead.  
- If you **meet a stranger on a lonely road**, make sure their feet touch the ground.  
- A sword passed down through **too many battles** may have its own will.  
- The fox that watches you from the forest **knows something you do not**.  

---

### **Trade and Commerce**  

Wealth and power flow through trade, but in *Kwaidan*, **not all merchants deal in earthly goods**.  

- **Silk, Rice & Metal** – The lifeblood of noble houses. Many merchants travel in **heavily guarded caravans**, wary of both bandits and things that lurk in the dark.  
- **Cursed Goods & Spirit Relics** – Some peddlers **sell objects of unknown origin**—old swords, sealed jars, dolls that seem to blink. A buyer should always ask **where something came from**.  
- **Monk Charms & Protective Talismans** – Not all of these work, but **in a world filled with yokai, no one takes chances**.  
- **Blood Pacts & Ghost Deals** – In secret, some trade with **the dead**—for knowledge, power, or protection. But spirits **always demand a price**.  

---

### **Art and Culture**  

Music, theater, and poetry are not just forms of entertainment—they are **ways to ward off evil, honor the dead, and tell cautionary tales**.  

- **Noh & Kabuki Theater** – Performances that reenact **ghost stories and historical tragedies**. It is said that some masks hold **the emotions of past actors**, and wearing them too long **invites possession**.  
- **Calligraphy & Spirit Wards** – A written word can be **as powerful as a blade**. Some monks can **trap spirits within ink**, while others **write poetry that reveals hidden truths**.  
- **Tea Ceremonies & Divination** – A properly brewed cup can **soothe restless spirits** or reveal the **future in its patterns**.  

---

### **Magic and Mysticism**  

The supernatural is deeply embedded in everyday life. Those who understand it **may wield it**, but those who misuse it **are often doomed by it**.  

- **Onmyodo (陰陽道)** – The way of **yin and yang**, practiced by onmyoji who control **spirits, wards, and the elements**.  
- **Kaji (Fire Rituals, 加持)** – Used by monks to **burn away corruption** and purify cursed objects.  
- **Fox Magic & Shapeshifting** – Kitsune (fox spirits) possess knowledge of **illusion, disguise, and transformation**. Some humans **bargain for their secrets**, at a cost.  
- **Blood Oaths & Spirit Contracts** – Some warriors **bind spirits into their weapons**—but these weapons have **wills of their own**.  
- **The Land’s Wrath** – When **mountains, rivers, and forests** are disrespected, they respond with **floods, landslides, and misfortune**.  

---

### **Folklore and Mythology**  

The world of *Kwaidan* is shaped by **stories of gods, ghosts, and monsters**, passed down for generations.  

- **Yokai (妖怪)** – Tricksters, beasts, and creatures of **half-spirit, half-myth**. Some are **playful**, others **deadly**.

- **Tsukumogami (付喪神)** – Objects that, after **100 years**, awaken with **souls and memories of their owners**.  

## **Factions & Organizations**  

The world of *Loner: Kwaidan* is shaped by **rival factions, secretive orders, and supernatural societies**, each with its own **agenda, motives, and hidden struggles**. These six factions influence the balance between **humans, spirits, and yokai**, sometimes acting as guardians, and at other times, as the very source of conflict.  

Each faction holds **secrets, alliances, and rivalries**, ensuring that no journey is without unexpected encounters.  

---

### **The Sohei Brotherhood**  
- **Concept**: Militant Monks  
- **Skills**: **Exorcism, Martial Arts**  
- **Frailty**: **Unyielding Fanaticism**  
- **Gear**: **Blessed Naginata, Prayer Beads of Protection**  
- **Goal**: **Eradicate yokai and evil spirits to purify the land.**  
- **Motive**: **The world is corrupted, and only holy discipline can cleanse it.**  
- **Nemesis**: **The Fox Court, whom they see as deceivers of men.**  

The Sohei Brotherhood are a militant sect of warrior-monks who view all supernatural entities as **a threat to human purity**. While they excel in **ritual combat and exorcisms**, their rigid view of the world has led them to **hunt even benign spirits and misunderstood yokai**.  

Not all monks follow this path—some within the Brotherhood **question its extremism**, leading to internal strife. However, to openly oppose the order is to risk **being labeled a heretic and hunted down**.  

---

### **The Fox Court**

Foxes are bound by **strange supernatural laws**—they **must honor deals, cannot lie outright, and must return favors**. They orchestrate **intrigues in noble courts, assist lost souls, and guard yokai shrines** from human destruction. However, their **mischief is not always well-received**, making them **both feared and sought after**.  

---

- **Motive**: **The world must not be overrun by lingering spirits.**  
- **Nemesis**: **The Shogun’s Onmyoji, whom they see as corrupt mystics.**  

The Silent Exorcists are a **wandering order of spirit-sealers** who communicate only through **written calligraphy and hand gestures**. They believe that speaking aloud **allows spirits to twist their words**, and so their knowledge is contained within their **forbidden scrolls and secret rituals**.  

Feared for their **unnerving presence and ghostly silence**, they are nonetheless respected for their skill in **dealing with malevolent spirits and yokai**. Some suspect that **those who fail in their trials are themselves bound into their cursed scrolls**—but no Silent Exorcist will ever confirm or deny it.  

---

The Shogun’s Onmyoji are **court sorcerers and spiritual advisors**, wielding **arcane knowledge, elemental magic, and political influence**. Unlike monks or wandering mystics, they **work within the system**, serving as the Shogun’s **hidden hand against supernatural threats**.  

Though they perform **valuable services such as reading omens, controlling the weather, and sealing curses**, many see them as **power-hungry manipulators who hoard spiritual secrets**. Some even whisper that they **strike deals with yokai for their own gain**, though such accusations rarely reach the ears of the living.  

---

### **The Whispering Blades**

- **Motive**: **Justice must be carried out, even from the shadows.**  
- **Nemesis**: **The Dragon Clan, who believe in honorable combat.**  

The Whispering Blades are **an order of assassins and spies**, known for their **silent killings, hidden techniques, and supernatural abilities**. Each member is **marked by a spirit**, binding them to their order and ensuring that **death follows their every step**.  

Legends say that when a Whispering Blade **fails to complete a mission**, the spirit that haunts them **claims their soul as punishment**. Many among them seek to **atone for their bloodstained past**, but few ever escape the cycle of **murder, duty, and retribution**.  

---

- **Goal**: **Unite the land under a righteous banner.**

- **Nemesis**: **The Whispering Blades, whom they see as dishonorable killers.**  

The Dragon Clan is one of the last noble houses still **adhering to the old ways of bushido (武士道, "the way of the warrior")**. They seek to bring **order to a land plagued by war and supernatural unrest**, holding themselves to a **strict code of honor and discipline**.  

However, their rigid ideals have made them **blind to the changing world**—while they refuse to **strike from the shadows or negotiate with yokai**, their enemies **have no such reservations**. Even among their own ranks, whispers of **betrayal and unrest** suggest that the clan’s **future is uncertain**.  

---

### **The Ties That Bind Them**  

These factions **do not exist in isolation**—they **interact, conspire, and clash**, shaping the world’s fate.  

- The **Sohei Brotherhood** fights an **eternal war against yokai**, often coming into conflict with the **Fox Court**, who protect their own kind.  
- The **Silent Exorcists** and **Shogun’s Onmyoji** both deal with **supernatural threats**, but where one seeks **balance**, the other seeks **control**.  
- The **Whispering Blades** operate in **shadow and secrecy**, a direct contrast to the **Dragon Clan**, who believes in open, honorable combat.  

Whether you serve a faction, stand against them, or walk your own path, the world of *Kwaidan* is one of **secrets, honor, and ghosts that refuse to rest**.  

Who will you align with? And who will become your **greatest enemy**?
