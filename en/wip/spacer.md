# Loner: Spacer

*Loner: Spacer* is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos. This game immerses you in the life of a lone starfarer navigating a galaxy filled with dangers, opportunities, and mysteries. Will you become a legendary trader, a daring explorer, or a feared outlaw? The choice—and the stars—are yours.

## Introduction

*Loner: Spacer* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you’ll need a few six-sided dice, writing materials, and your imagination. Optional tools like a star map or digital randomizers can enhance the experience.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few key rules and a flexible oracle mechanic that adapts to any scenario.
3. **Tag-Based**: Characters, starships, factions, and even planetary systems are defined by descriptive tags rather than numbers.

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Loner: Spacer* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Loner: Spacer* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Loner: Spacer** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as *"Reckless Pilot,"* *"Ace Navigator,"* *"Cunning Smuggler,"* or *"Starry-Eyed Explorer."*



## Characters

In *Loner: Spacer*, characters are the heart of your spacefaring adventure. Whether you're a daring pilot, a cunning trader, or an enigmatic drifter, your character will be defined by narrative-driven traits. Every decision, challenge, and victory helps shape their journey through the stars.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Loner: Spacer*, everything of significance—whether it’s a starship, a rival faction, or a deadly alien—is treated as a character. This ensures consistency across gameplay and simplifies mechanics.  

Your protagonist is described by several fixed traits:

- **Name**: Choose a name that resonates with the galaxy’s setting, memorable and iconic.
- **Concept**: Summarize your character with an evocative phrase, such as *"Clever Rogue Trader"* or *"Haunted Scout Pilot."*
- **Skills** (x2): Two specific proficiencies that give your character an edge. Avoid generic terms like *"Smart";* instead, use unique skills like *"Hyperdrive Technician"* or *"Bluff Master."*
- **Frailty**: A flaw that creates challenges, such as *"Impulsive Gambler"* or *"Paranoid Survivor."*
- **Gear** (x2): Two pieces of specialized equipment integral to your character, like *"Handheld Plasma Cutter"* or *"Holo-Chart Navigator."* Everyday items are assumed.
- **Goal**: Your long-term aspiration—what your character is working toward, such as *"Escape a Criminal Past"* or *"Find a Mythical Star Relic."*
- **Motive**: The reason that drives the pursuit of the goal, such as *"Prove my Worth"* or *"Seek Redemption."*
- **Nemesis**: A personal enemy, rival, or opposing faction. This may emerge during gameplay, adding complexity and tension.
- **Luck**: A measure of fortune and resilience. Starts and caps at 6, and resets after conflicts.

## Rules

*Loner: Spacer* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Loner: Spacer* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Loner: Spacer* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## **Spacecraft Design and Customization**

Your spacecraft is an integral part of your character’s story and a reflection of their role in the galaxy. Ships are described using **tags** and **modules**.

### **Core Traits**
Every spacecraft starts with the following core traits:

- **Name**: A unique and memorable name for the ship, such as *"Starlight Shadow"* or *"Void Whisper."*
- **Type**: Describes the general purpose of the ship, such as *"Trader,"* *"Explorer,"* *"Fighter,"* or *"Courier."*
- **Modules** (x4): Each ship has at least four distinct modules, representing functional systems. Examples include *"Hyperdrive Unit,"* *"Cargo Bay,"* and *"Sensor Array."*
- **Condition**: A qualitative measure of the ship's overall state, such as *"Pristine,"* *"Worn,"* or *"Malfunctioning."*  
- **Frailty**: A unique drawback that affects performance, like *"Weak Structural Integrity"* or *"Underpowered Reactor."*

### **Customizing Your Ship**
Customization occurs during play using tags and oracle-driven prompts. A ship can be modified by adding or upgrading **modules**, which enhance or change its capabilities.

#### **Module Examples**
| **Category**      | **Examples**                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Propulsion**     | Basic Thrusters, Ion Engines, Warp Drive |
| **Weapons**        | Laser Cannons, Missile Launchers, EMP Blaster |
| **Defensive**      | Energy Shields, Reinforced Hull, Cloaking Device |
| **Utility**        | Advanced Sensors, Repair Drones, Science Lab |
| **Cargo**          | Smuggler's Hold, Refrigerated Storage, Expanded Bay |

#### **Upgrading Modules**
To upgrade a module:
1. **Determine Availability**: Ask the oracle whether the upgrade is available at your current location.
2. **Check Requirements**: Modules may require tags like *"Advanced Engineering"* or *"Alien Tech Specialist."*
3. **Pay Costs**: Use the economic system to purchase or barter for upgrades.

## **Equipment and Gear**
Characters rely on specialized gear to survive the harshness of space.

#### **Equipment Categories**

| **Category**      | **Examples**                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Exploration**    | Jetpack, Portable Oxygen Tank, Terrain Mapper |
| **Combat**         | Plasma Cutter, Energy Shield, Phase Blaster |
| **Utility**        | Holo-Chart Navigator, Multitool, Portable Repair Kit |
| **Survival**       | Emergency Shelter, Rations Pack, Heat Regulator |

#### **Gear Tags**
- Gear is defined by tags like *"Lightweight,"* *"Durable,"* or *"High-Tech."*
- Tags determine how gear interacts with the environment and challenges. For example, *"Waterproof"* may grant an **Advantage** during waterlogged conditions.

#### **Maintaining Gear**
Ask the oracle if a piece of gear malfunctions or requires maintenance after prolonged use. Tags like *"Reliable"* or *"Old and Worn"* influence these outcomes.

## **Economic System**

The economy in *Loner: Spacer* is a narrative-driven system for managing credits, bartering, and maintaining your ship and gear.

### **Credits and Costs**
- **Credits** are the universal currency. Tag your financial state with terms like *"Wealthy,"* *"Barely Scraping By,"* or *"Broke."*
- When buying, selling, or upgrading, consult the oracle to determine prices and availability.

### **Maintenance Costs**
Regular ship upkeep is essential:
- Small ships: Low cost (e.g., *"A week’s fuel costs 200 credits"*)  
- Large ships: Higher maintenance (e.g., *"Docking fees are 1,000 credits/day."*)

### **Bartering**
Instead of credits, barter goods (like rare minerals or tech parts) can be used:
1. **Offer Trade**: Describe the goods you’re trading and ask the oracle if the deal is favorable.
2. **Negotiate**: Use tags like *"Persuasive"* or *"Untrustworthy Trader"* to determine the outcome.

## **Cargo and Trading Mechanics**

### **Cargo Management**
Your ship’s cargo capacity is determined by the **Cargo Bay Module** and relevant tags. Cargo is described with tags like *"Fragile,"* *"Perishable,"* or *"Highly Valuable."*

- **Capacity**: Tags like *"Spacious"* or *"Limited"* determine how much you can store.
- **Conditions**: Check for damage or loss during hazardous travel by consulting the oracle.

### **Trading System**
Engage in trade at ports and stations:
1. **Find Buyers/Sellers**: Roll on a **Trade Encounter Table** to determine available goods and buyers.
2. **Determine Prices**: Use the oracle to set fluctuating prices based on supply, demand, and location.
3. **Risk and Profit**: High-value goods may attract pirates or customs inspections. Tags like *"Illegal Goods"* add complications.

#### **Trade Encounter Table (D6)**
| **Roll** | **Event**                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Scarce resources: High demand, high prices |
| 2        | Flooded market: Low prices for your goods |
| 3        | Black market opportunities               |
| 4        | Routine trade: Fair prices               |
| 5        | Potential buyer needs rare goods         |
| 6        | Dangerous client offers risky deal       |

### **Special Cargo**
Some cargo has unique narrative importance, such as *"Ancient Alien Artifact"* or *"Experimental Tech Prototype."* These items can trigger plot twists or influence faction relationships.

| 6      | Rare Resource Cluster           |

### **Navigation and Travel**

Space travel involves precise calculations and careful resource management. All travel distances are measured in **Light Units (LU)**—a narrative measure of distance.

#### **Travel Procedure**
1. **Determine Destination**: Select a nearby system or roll the oracle to randomly choose.
2. **Calculate Distance**: Roll 1d6 for the distance in LU. Tags like *"Navigational Charts"* or *"Astrogation Expert"* may influence the outcome.
3. **Check Resources**: Ensure your ship has sufficient fuel and supplies for the journey.
4. **Resolve Travel**: Roll on the **Space Travel Encounter Table** (see below).

#### **Fuel and Resource Management**
- Each ship has a **Fuel Capacity**, defined by its tags. Example: *"Efficient Engines"* may use less fuel.
- **Resource Consumption**: For each LU traveled, deduct 1 unit of fuel or supplies. A tag like *"Extended Fuel Tanks"* allows for longer journeys.
- **Refueling**: Purchase fuel at spaceports or mine resources in systems with asteroid belts or gas giants (requires *"Mining Equipment"* tag).

#### **Travel Failure**
If you run out of fuel or supplies, ask the oracle if a distress beacon brings help or leads to an encounter. Tags like *"High Traffic Region"* or *"Remote Space"* influence outcomes.

### **Hyperspace/Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Travel**

FTL travel allows you to bypass vast distances but introduces unique risks.

#### **FTL Jump Procedure**
1. **Spool Hyperdrive**: Takes 1d6 in-game hours. Tags like *"Advanced Hyperdrive"* may reduce this.
2. **Plot Course**: Roll 2d6. A result of 7+ means a clear path. Otherwise, consult the **FTL Mishap Table**.
3. **Jump to Hyperspace**: Each jump consumes significant fuel—calculate based on distance.

##### **FTL Mishap Table (2d6)**
| **Roll** | **Result**                         |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| 2        | Catastrophic Malfunction (emergency exit) |
| 3-4      | Severe Navigation Error (lost in space) |
| 5-6      | Minor System Damage               |
| 7-8      | Unstable Jump (takes longer)      |
| 9-10     | Encounter Hazard (see encounter table) |
| 11-12    | Smooth Jump                       |

### **Space Travel Encounter Table**

During travel, roll 2d6 to determine events or challenges.

| **Roll** | **Encounter**                             |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| 2        | Hostile Pirate Ambush                    |
| 3        | Derelict Ship or Station                 |
| 4        | Asteroid Field                           |
| 5        | Space Weather (solar flares, storms)     |
| 6        | Alien Contact (hostile or neutral)       |
| 7        | Peaceful Journey                         |
| 8        | Trader Ship Encounter                    |
| 9        | Navigational Error                       |
| 10       | Distress Signal                          |
| 11       | Mysterious Phenomenon                    |
| 12       | Valuable Discovery                       |

## Economy and Trading

The economic system in *Loner: Spacer* is built around dynamic, oracle-driven trading mechanics. It focuses on the flow of commodities, fluctuating markets, and the player's ability to influence their reputation and profitability within an interstellar economy.

### **Commodity and Trade Route Mechanics**

Trading is a central activity for players who choose the merchant or smuggler path. Commodities are defined by **tags** that influence their value and transport requirements.

#### **Step 1: Determine Commodities**
Roll on the **Commodity Table** to identify trade goods available at your current location.

| **D6** | **Commodity**       | **Tags**                      |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1      | Food Supplies       | Perishable, High Demand       |
| 2      | Precious Metals     | Compact, High Value           |
| 3      | Advanced Tech       | Fragile, Restricted           |
| 4      | Alien Artifacts     | Mysterious, Illegal           |
| 5      | Industrial Goods    | Heavy, Bulk                   |
| 6      | Medical Supplies    | Critical, Time-Sensitive      |

#### **Step 2: Trade Routes**
Determine a destination system using the **Trade Route Table** (roll 1d6).

| **D6** | **Route Condition**            | **Tags**                      |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1-2    | Well-Traveled                  | Safe, Moderate Profit          |
| 3-4    | Isolated                       | Risky, High Profit Potential   |
| 5      | Faction-Controlled             | Taxed, Dangerous               |
| 6      | Smuggler's Run                 | Illegal, High Reward           |

Use the route condition to influence pricing and encounters during travel.

### **Economic Simulation for Star Systems**

Each star system has an economy based on its **Tags**, which define its wealth, industry, and demand. 

#### **System Economic Tags**
| **Category**        | **Examples**                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Wealth**          | Rich, Poor, Moderate        |
| **Specialization**  | Agricultural, Industrial, Technological |
| **Demand**          | High, Low, Stable          |

Ask the oracle or roll 2d6 to assign tags to a system:
- 2-4: Poor Economy
- 5-9: Moderate Economy
- 10-12: Rich Economy

These tags influence the availability of commodities, pricing, and trading opportunities.

#### **Example System Economies**
- **Rich Technological Hub**: *"Advanced Tech" has low prices but high demand in neighboring systems.*
- **Poor Agricultural World**: *"Food Supplies" are cheap but in high demand elsewhere.*

### **Pricing and Market Fluctuation Rules**

Prices fluctuate based on the system’s economic tags and current events.

#### **Base Pricing**
Use the **Commodity Price Table** to establish baseline prices.

| **Commodity**       | **Base Price (per unit)** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Food Supplies       | 50 Credits               |
| Precious Metals     | 500 Credits              |
| Advanced Tech       | 1,000 Credits            |
| Alien Artifacts     | 2,000 Credits            |
| Industrial Goods    | 200 Credits              |
| Medical Supplies    | 300 Credits              |

#### **Price Modifiers**
Adjust base prices by rolling 1d6 and consulting the **Market Modifier Table**.

| **D6** | **Price Modifier**       |
|--------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Halved (Flooded Market)  |
| 2-3    | -25%                    |
| 4-5    | +25%                    |
| 6      | Doubled (High Demand)    |

Modifiers are further influenced by tags:
- *"High Demand"* adds +1 to the roll.
- *"Illegal Commodity"* always starts with a +25% price increase.
- *"Perishable"* may reduce price if delivery is delayed.

### **Reputation and Trading Influence**

Reputation reflects your character's standing within the trading community, influencing prices, access, and opportunities.

#### **Reputation Tags**
Your reputation is described by tags like:
- *"Trusted Merchant"* (discounts at ports)
- *"Notorious Smuggler"* (access to black markets)
- *"Unreliable Dealer"* (reduced customer base)

#### **Building Reputation**
- Deliver goods on time: Gain a positive tag like *"Dependable."*
- Smuggle or cheat factions: Gain negative tags like *"Blacklisted by Faction X."*
- Ask the oracle after major trades to determine how your actions impact reputation.

#### **Reputation Effects**
- Positive reputation may grant discounts, protection, or exclusive contracts.
- Negative reputation may lead to higher taxes, fewer trade options, or faction hostility.

#### **Faction-Specific Influence**
Factions track your reputation using a sliding scale from *"Friendly"* to *"Hostile."* Major trades, betrayals, or aiding their rivals will shift their perception of you.

### **Trade Events and Opportunities**

Add dynamism to trading with random events and opportunities.

#### **Trade Opportunity Table (2d6)**
| **Roll** | **Event**                                    |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2        | Rare commodity auction (requires credits)   |
| 3        | Faction trade embargo                      |
| 4        | Supply shortage (prices double temporarily)|
| 5        | Pirate blockade near trade route           |
| 6        | Black market dealer offers a high-risk deal|
| 7        | Routine trade                              |
| 8        | Local festival (prices for luxury goods increase) |
| 9        | Trade permit revoked (temporary)           |
| 10       | Major faction offers lucrative contract    |
| 11       | Smuggler requests help transporting goods  |
| 12       | Discovery of a hidden trade route          |

## Mission and Adventure Generation

Creating compelling missions and adventures is vital to crafting your emergent narrative. These mechanics provide a structure to generate random missions, create unique storylines, and introduce environmental challenges.

### **Random Mission Generation Tables**

Generate missions dynamically using these tables. Roll a series of dice to define the mission’s **Objective**, **Complication**, **Reward**, and **Setting**.

#### **Mission Objective Table (1d6)**

| 3        | Derelict Space Station      |
| 4        | Alien Planet                |
| 5        | Asteroid Belt               |
| 6        | Deep Space Anomaly          |

#### **Quick Example**
- **Objective**: Retrieve Rare Artifact
- **Complication**: Hostile Faction Involvement
- **Reward**: Favor from a Faction
- **Setting**: Derelict Space Station

This mission would involve retrieving an artifact from a derelict station while avoiding or outsmarting a hostile faction, with the added incentive of gaining a valuable favor.

### **Narrative Framework for Unique Adventures**

The *Loner: Spacer* framework allows you to build complex, engaging narratives using oracle-driven prompts and tag-based storytelling. Follow this structure to develop adventures:

#### **Step 1: Start with a Hook**
Roll or decide on an initial event to kickstart the adventure. Example hooks:
- A distress signal from a stranded vessel (*"Unknown Origin" tag*).
- A lucrative job offer from a faction (*"Urgent and High-Paying" tag*).
- Discovery of a mysterious star map leading to uncharted space.

#### **Step 2: Layer Challenges**
Add challenges to create tension. Use the **Environmental Challenge Systems** below or the **Mission Complication Table** to introduce obstacles. Challenges should align with the mission’s tags.

#### **Step 3: Develop NPC and Faction Ties**
Include NPCs or factions that connect to the mission. Example:
- A rival smuggler complicates the mission (*"Cunning and Ruthless"* tag).
- A faction offers unexpected assistance in exchange for a favor (*"Influential but Demanding"* tag).

#### **Step 4: Add Twists**
Incorporate twists using the oracle or roll on the **Mission Twist Table** (1d6):

| **Roll** | **Twist**                             |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| 1        | The true goal is not what it seems    |
| 2        | An ally betrays you                   |
| 3        | A new threat emerges mid-mission      |
| 4        | The environment becomes unstable      |
| 5        | A valuable opportunity arises         |
| 6        | The mission changes factions’ perceptions of you |

### **Environmental Challenge Systems**

Space is hostile and unpredictable. The following systems introduce environmental challenges that add depth and difficulty to your missions.

#### **Hazard Table (1d6)**
| **Roll** | **Hazard**                   | **Tags**                       |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1        | Solar Storm                  | Disruptive, Hazardous          |
| 2        | Meteor Shower                | Chaotic, High Damage Potential |
| 3        | Black Hole Gravitational Pull | Unpredictable, High Risk       |

| 6        | Unstable Terrain             | Fragile, Dangerous             |

#### **Survival Mechanics**
When encountering a hazard:
1. **Assess Tags**: Use relevant ship or character tags (e.g., *"Shielded Hull"* or *"Expert Pilot"*) to determine if you have an **Advantage**.
2. **Consult the Oracle**: Ask whether the hazard can be mitigated or overcome.
3. **Apply Consequences**: If unsuccessful, impose narrative consequences, such as damage to equipment (*"Weakened Hull"*) or increased tension with factions (*"Law Enforcement Suspicious"*).

#### **Environmental Interactions**
Characters can attempt to modify the environment using equipment:
- **Action**: Use a tool or system, like deploying drones or stabilizing a station.
- **Outcome**: Consult the oracle or apply tags like *"Specialized Tools"* for success.

### **Adventure Creation Example**

1. **Hook**: You receive an urgent distress call from an abandoned mining colony.  
   - Tags: *"Remote,"* *"Rich Resources,"* *"Dangerous."*

2. **Objective**: Retrieve medical supplies for survivors.  
   - Roll: Mission Objective = Rescue/Extraction.

3. **Complication**: The colony is under attack by hostile alien fauna.  
   - Roll: Mission Complication = Hostile Faction Involvement (Aliens).

4. **Reward**: A faction offers payment in rare resources for your aid.  
   - Roll: Mission Reward = Rare Resource.

5. **Setting**: The mission takes place in a hazardous asteroid belt.  
   - Roll: Mission Setting = Asteroid Belt.

6. **Challenge**: Mid-mission, a solar storm destabilizes the colony.  
   - Roll: Hazard = Solar Storm.

7. **Twist**: The supplies include a mysterious alien artifact.  
   - Roll: Twist = The true goal is not what it seems.

## World-Building Tools

Creating a vibrant galaxy filled with alien civilizations, factions, and diverse cultures is essential to making your solo RPG experience immersive. The following tools provide structured guidelines for designing alien species, political systems, and cultural and technological diversity.

### **Alien Civilization Creation Guidelines**

Alien civilizations add mystery and depth to the galaxy. Use these steps to define their unique traits.

| Expansive Territory        | Poor Resource Management  |

#### **Example Civilization**
- **Core Traits**: Amphibious, Communal, Advanced Technology, Cooperative  
- **Cultural Quirk**: Ritualistic  
- **Communication**: Bioluminescent Signals  
- **Strength**: Resilient Biology  
- **Weakness**: Poor Resource Management  

This results in a species of peaceful amphibians that thrive in their watery worlds but struggle with ecological sustainability.

### **Faction and Political Systems**

Factions shape the political and economic dynamics of the galaxy. Each faction is described by a set of traits.

#### **Step 1: Faction Traits**
Define the faction with the following tags:
- **Concept**: Summarize the faction’s identity (e.g., *"Galactic Trade Guild"* or *"Pirate Confederacy"*).
- **Skills** (x2): Two general traits that define what they excel at (e.g., *"Efficient Logistics"* or *"Espionage Specialists"*).
- **Frailty**: A notable weakness (e.g., *"Corrupt Leadership"* or *"Overextended Territories"*).
- **Motive**: The faction’s overarching goal (e.g., *"Control Trade Routes"* or *"Destroy Rival Factions"*).

#### **Step 2: Diplomacy**
Determine the faction’s stance toward others. Use the **Faction Relations Matrix** to define relationships as:
- **Allied**: Strong cooperation.
- **Friendly**: Positive interactions.
- **Neutral**: Indifference.
- **Tense**: Suspicious or strained.
- **Hostile**: Open conflict.

| **Faction A**      | **Faction B**   | **Faction C** |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Galactic Trade Guild| Neutral         | Friendly      |
| Pirate Confederacy  | Hostile         | Neutral       |
| Planetary Coalition | Friendly        | Tense         |

#### **Step 3: Power Structures**
Roll on the **Faction Leadership Table** (1d6) to determine the faction’s governance style:

| **Roll** | **Leadership Style**         |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 1        | Autocracy (Single Ruler)     |
| 2        | Oligarchy (Council)          |
| 3        | Democracy                    |
| 4        | Corporate Board              |
| 5        | AI Governance                |
| 6        | Anarchy                      |

#### **Example Faction**
- **Concept**: Planetary Coalition  
- **Skills**: Advanced Diplomacy, Strong Military Defense  
- **Frailty**: Fragmented Leadership  
- **Motive**: Maintain Galactic Peace  
- **Relations**: Neutral with Trade Guild, Tense with Pirates  
- **Leadership**: Democratic Council  

### **Cultural and Technological Diversity Frameworks**

The galaxy is a tapestry of diverse cultures and technologies. These frameworks help you design civilizations, planets, and factions that feel distinct.

#### **Cultural Diversity**
Assign cultures to planets or regions using the **Cultural Archetype Table** (1d6):

| **Roll** | **Cultural Archetype**       |
|----------|------------------------------|
