# **Savage Blades of Xylandra**

***Savage Blades of Xylandra*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in the vibrant, treacherous world of Xylandra—a realm of high magic and advanced technology, where sprawling deserts meet shimmering skies, and ancient mysteries lie buried beneath endless sands.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to immerse you in the daring escapades and cosmic intrigues of Xylandra, where your choices shape the fate of a planet teetering between brilliance and ruin.

## Introduction

*Savage Blades of Xylandra* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common six-sided dice and writing materials. Everything else is optional.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few core rules and a single narrative-driven mechanic that is easy to learn and master.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined by evocative descriptors rather than numerical attributes.

In *Savage Blades of Xylandra*, your character emerges from Earth into an alien world, facing political intrigue, ancient artifacts, and boundless danger. Character creation revolves around thematic tags, such as *"Desert Nomad"* or *"Relic Seeker"*, and gameplay focuses on uncovering secrets and confronting perilous challenges.

## Setting Introduction

Welcome to Xylandra, a world suspended between blazing suns and haunting moons, where sprawling deserts, crystalline glaciers, and dense jungles create a land of extremes. High technology mingles with ancient magic, giving rise to awe-inspiring airships, arcane war machines, and relics of untold power.

1. **The Great Desert**: A sun-scorched expanse of shifting dunes and forgotten cities. Nomads traverse this treacherous terrain, whispering tales of sand golems and hidden vaults.
2. **The Frozen Wastes**: A realm of biting cold, where Frostwalkers and ice giants guard the crystalline secrets buried beneath the snow.
3. **The Jungle of Vines**: A pulsating tangle of life, where carnivorous plants and venomous beasts vie for dominance in shadowy glades.
4. **The Sea of Sand**: A mystifying expanse of dunes that shimmer like ocean waves, concealing luminous crystals and roaming sandstorms.
5. **The Oasis Lands**: Fertile havens ruled by the enigmatic Merchants' Guild, whose airships and radiant towers pierce the horizon.

Amid this vibrant chaos, factions clash for dominance, mysterious artifacts alter destinies, and cosmic alignments promise both enlightenment and disaster.

### Playable Themes

In *Savage Blades of Xylandra*, your journey can explore:

- **Survival in Hostile Terrain**: Navigate the Great Desert’s scorching sun, sandworms, and shifting dunes or brave the glacial storms of the Frozen Wastes.
- **Faction Intrigue**: Ally with or oppose the Merchants' Guild, the elemental Brotherhood of the Sand, or the shadowy Order of the Void.
- **Artifact Hunting**: Unearth ancient relics in lost cities or beneath frozen glaciers, contending with traps, rival seekers, and their unpredictable power.
- **Cosmic Mysticism**: Harness the energies of Xylandra’s twin suns and five moons, mastering celestial or elemental magics.

## Rules

*Savage Blades of Xylandra* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Savage Blades of Xylandra* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Savage Blades of Xylandra* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

### Setting Related Rules

In *Savage Blades of Xylandra*, the game incorporates setting-specific mechanics to heighten the tension, danger, and discovery inherent to this mysterious and treacherous world. These rules use the oracular system to handle the unique challenges and opportunities presented by Xylandra’s environment, factions, and artifacts.

#### Sandstorms and Environmental Hazards

**Rule**: When traversing harsh environments like the Great Desert, the Sea of Sand, or the Frozen Wastes, consult the Oracle to determine if a hazard is encountered.

- **Ask the Oracle**: “Do I encounter an environmental hazard?”
- On a **Yes**, roll 2d6 to determine the hazard:
  | D6  | Hazard                                | Effect                                                              |
  | --- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1   | Sandstorm                             | Vision obscured, movement slowed, navigation rolls at a disadvantage. |
  | 2   | Quicksand                             | Immediate risk to survival; escape requires a successful action roll. |
  | 3   | Extreme Heat/Frost                    | Take 1 Luck damage or find shelter.                                |
  | 4   | Wandering Predator                    | Roll for a creature encounter (use the Bestiary).                  |
  | 5   | Arcane Phenomenon                     | The environment manifests unpredictable magic; consult the Oracle. |
  | 6   | Lost Bearings                         | Lose track of your destination; navigation requires two successes. |

**Advantage/Disadvantage**: Environmental tags like "Shelter Nearby" or "Sand Mage" may provide advantages or mitigate hazards, while frailties like "Desert Amnesia" may impose disadvantages.

---

#### Faction Interference

**Rule**: Xylandra’s factions constantly vie for power, resources, and influence. When entering a new region or pursuing a goal, roll to determine faction presence.

- **Ask the Oracle**: “Are factions present or interfering?”
- On a **Yes**, roll 2d6 to determine the faction and its role:
  | D6  | Faction                               | Interference                                                      |
  | --- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1   | Merchants’ Guild                      | Trade dispute, resource hoarding, or deceptive deals.             |
  | 2   | Brotherhood of the Sand               | Sacred site protection or accusations of defilement.              |
  | 3   | Order of the Void                     | Hidden manipulation or necromantic sabotage.                      |
  | 4   | Warlords                              | Aggressive demands for tribute or outright conflict.              |
  | 5   | Cult of the Shifting Sands            | Mysterious prophecy or forced participation in a ritual.          |
  | 6   | Local Nomads or Minor Tribes          | Offering aid, seeking help, or demanding respect.                 |

**Resolution**: Treat faction interference as a narrative event. Conflicts may arise requiring negotiation, combat, or subterfuge. Use tags such as "Diplomat" or "Shadow Operative" to resolve these situations.

---

#### Relic Discovery and Activation

**Rule**: Relics are powerful artifacts scattered across Xylandra, often hidden in ruins or guarded by powerful foes. Discovering and activating a relic is a high-stakes endeavor.

- **Ask the Oracle**: “Do I discover a relic?”
- On a **Yes**, roll 2d6 to determine its nature:
  | D6  | Relic Type                            | Effect or Benefit                                                |
  | --- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1   | Aether Crystal                        | Grants temporary energy for spells or vehicles.                 |
  | 2   | Celestial Shard                       | Enhances Luck by +2 for one scene, but at a cost (roll Oracle). |
  | 3   | Void Lens                             | Reveals hidden paths or truths, but risks mental strain.         |
  | 4   | Arcane Weapon                         | Adds an offensive advantage in combat for a limited time.       |
  | 5   | Sand-bound Amulet                     | Manipulates sand, allowing terrain control.                     |
  | 6   | Star Map                              | Guides to hidden locations, reducing travel difficulties.       |

**Activation Challenge**: Relics may require a successful roll, specific resources, or narrative actions to unlock their power. Failure may trigger unpredictable effects.

---

#### Cosmic Alignments and Magic

**Rule**: Xylandra’s twin suns and five moons exert a powerful influence on magic. When casting a spell or attempting a magical action, consult the Oracle to determine alignment effects.

- **Ask the Oracle**: “Are the celestial alignments favorable?”
  - On a **Yes**, gain an advantage for the magical action.

# **Magic**

Magic on Xylandra is a dynamic and narrative-driven force, relying on evocative tags and oracle resolution to shape its impact. Each magic type offers unique thematic tools for solving problems, overcoming challenges, or enhancing the narrative.

### Using Magic

1. **Describe the Action**: Define what your character is attempting using their magic.
2. **Resolve via Oracle**: Consult the oracle for outcomes. Tags, traits, and contextual details determine advantages or disadvantages.
3. **Add Consequences**: Failure may result in unintended effects, while success could drain resources or attract unwanted attention.

## **Sand Magic**

The power of the desert embodied, Sand Magic thrives in arid landscapes. Practiced by the Sandfolk and others attuned to the Great Desert, it uses the fluidity of sand to shield, deceive, or destroy.

- **Tags**: Flexible, Illusory, Defensive, Environmental
- **Examples of Use**:
  - **Storm Call**: Obscure an area with swirling sands; gain an advantage in stealth or escape.
  - **Mirage Crafting**: Create an illusion to distract or mislead foes; treat failed rolls as exposing the illusion.
  - **Quicksand Traps**: Immobilize enemies by manipulating terrain; requires proximity to sand or loose soil.
  - **Sand Constructs**: Shape sand into tools, weapons, or creatures for limited use.
- **Challenges**:
  - Sand Magic is resource-intensive, requiring nearby sand or loose material.
  - Overuse may attract the attention of desert spirits or cause physical exhaustion.

## **Ice Magic**

Harnessed in the Frozen Wastes, Ice Magic is sharp, precise, and unyielding. It excels in defense, control, and destructive bursts but falters outside cold climates.

- **Tags**: Precise, Defensive, Slow, Elemental
- **Examples of Use**:
  - **Frost Barrage**: Fire shards of ice to injure or immobilize; add disadvantages for brittle or melting ice in warm conditions.
  - **Frozen Barrier**: Create a wall or shield of ice; adds advantage to defensive actions.
  - **Glacial Stride**: Freeze the ground to create slick paths or slow pursuers; risky if allies are nearby.
  - **Blizzard’s Wrath**: Summon a storm of ice and snow; roll for exhaustion or unintended consequences in prolonged use.
- **Challenges**:
  - Effectiveness decreases in warm regions.
  - Precise gestures are required; disruptions may cause misfires or backlash.

## **Celestial Magic**

Celestial Magic draws upon the energies of Xylandra’s twin suns and five moons. Its power fluctuates with celestial alignments, requiring timing and insight to harness its full potential.

- **Tags**: Cosmic, Amplified, Ritualistic, Unpredictable
- **Examples of Use**:
  - **Solar Flare**: Blind or burn foes with a burst of light; effective during daylight or under direct sunlight.
  - **Lunar Reflection**: Channel moonlight into illusions or revelations; adds advantage during nighttime.
  - **Starfall**: Summon meteoric energy to devastate an area; failure may cause collateral damage.
  - **Cosmic Shield**: Form a barrier of starlight; effective against physical and magical attacks alike.
- **Challenges**:
  - Alignment-dependent; magic may fail or backfire under unfavorable celestial conditions.
  - Rituals often require time, materials, or specific locations to succeed.

## **Fusion Magic**

A blend of arcane forces and advanced technology, Fusion Magic turns Xylandra’s relics and machines into tools of wonder and terror. Its power is unparalleled but volatile.

- **Tags**: Innovative, Powerful, Risky, Mechanical
- **Examples of Use**:
  - **Aether Crystals**: Infuse energy into devices to enhance functionality; risk of overloading or magical surges.
  - **Spell-forged Constructs**: Animate machines for combat or labor; constructs may malfunction or go rogue on failure.
  - **Elemental Engines**: Merge elemental magic (e.g., sand or ice) with vehicles to improve movement or attack power.
  - **Celestial Cannons**: Mount star-powered weapons onto airships; immense destructive power, but requires calibration to avoid catastrophic failures.
- **Challenges**:
  - Extremely unstable, requiring skilled control or support.
  - Malfunctions may harm allies or damage surrounding environments.

* **Opportunities**: Treasure hunters and adventurers are drawn here by rumors of lost cities and relics of immense power, guarded by both the elements and those who claim dominion over the sands.

### **The Frozen Wastes**

To the north, the Frozen Wastes stretch like a crystalline tundra under a sky that flickers with cold light. This land of snow and ice is as merciless as it is mesmerizing, home to ancient mysteries encased in frost.

* **Opportunities**: Those who dare to navigate its treacherous expanse may find rare resources or earn the favor of the elusive Sand Dancers, whose illusions can turn the tide of any confrontation.

### **The Oasis Lands**

To the west, the Oasis Lands are a haven of life and prosperity amid the surrounding desolation. Fertile oases and verdant valleys offer a stark contrast to the harshness of Xylandra, but this region is far from peaceful.

* **Notable Features**: Shimmering pools surrounded by lush vegetation, sprawling cities that gleam with technological marvels, and golden airship docks bustling with activity.

## **The Sky**

The sky of Xylandra is a mesmerizing sight to behold. During the day, the dual suns blaze with an intense heat that illuminates the landscape with a fiery orange hue. The suns themselves appear as giant, glowing orbs, casting long shadows and dazzling light across the land.

As night falls, the sky transforms into a canvas of wonder. Five moons adorn the sky, each with their own unique size, color, and texture. The largest of the moons, Aethon, shines with a silvery light, casting a gentle glow across the landscape. The smallest of the moons, Keth, appears as a distant pinprick of light, barely visible in the darkness. The other moons, named Saren, Althor, and Valdar, each possess their own distinct color and texture, ranging from a deep crimson hue to a smoky gray.

Despite the moons' beauty, they do little to dispel the darkness. It is said that the creatures of the night roam freely during the moonlit hours, their eyes glinting with a strange, otherworldly light. But for those brave enough to venture out into the night, the sight of the two suns slowly rising on the horizon is a breathtaking reminder of the dawn that will soon come.

### **Calendar**

* A year on Xylandra is based on the orbit of the planet around its suns, and it takes 400 standard days to complete one full orbit.  
* Xylandra's five moons each have their own distinct phases and cycles. The moons are named:  
  * Aethon  
  * Keth  
  * Saren  
  * Althor  
  * Valdar  
* The months of the Xylandraian calendar are named after the moons, with each month corresponding to a complete cycle of the corresponding moon. The length of a month varies depending on the moon, but the average length is about 80 days.  
* The first month of the year is Aethon, corresponding to the cycle of the moon of the same name. The other months follow in order according to the cycle of their corresponding moon.  
* Xylandraians also observe special days based on the positions of the two suns and the phases of the moons. These special days are:  
  * *Solstice*: A day when the suns are at their highest and the longest day of the year. This occurs twice a year, once for each sun.  
  * *Equinox*: A day when the suns are directly over the equator, resulting in equal periods of day and night. This also occurs twice a year, halfway between each solstice.  
* Moons Festival: A week-long celebration held during the full phase of all five moons, which occurs once every five years. This is a time of great feasting, celebration, and religious observance.  
* Xylandraians also observe a leap year, which occurs once every four years, to keep the calendar in sync with the planet's orbit around its suns. During a leap year, an extra day is added to the end of the year, resulting in a total of 401 days for that year.

### **Units of Measure**

* **Distance**: The base unit of distance is the "zar," which is equivalent to 10 feet (3 meters) in Earth's measurement system. Longer distances are typically measured in "zars" or "kazars" (100 zars), while shorter distances may be measured in "pazars" (0.1 zar) or "millizars" (0.001 zar).  
* **Weight**: The base unit of weight is the "zal," which is equivalent to 1 kilogram in Earth's measurement system. Larger weights are measured in "zals" or "kazals" (100 zals), while smaller weights may be measured in "pazals" (0.1 zal) or "millizals" (0.001 zal).  
* **Time**: The primary unit of time is the "cycle," which is equivalent to one day on Xylandra (roughly 25 Earth hours). A "cycle" is divided into 24 "hours," which are each made up of 60 "minutes" and 60 "seconds." Longer durations of time may be measured in "cycles," while shorter durations may be measured in "ticks" (0.1 seconds) or "milliticks" (0.001 seconds).

These measurements are widely used across Xylandra and are recognized by most of its inhabitants, though there may be some variations or regional differences in the specific units or conversions used in different areas of the world.

## **People**

The inhabitants of Xylandra are as diverse and extraordinary as the world itself.

* **Culture**: Scholars of the ineffable, the Nytherin dedicate their lives to unravelling the threads of the universe’s secrets. Their societies are built around ancient libraries and sanctuaries where luminous glyphs pulse with arcane energy.

* **Beliefs**: Some say the Nytherin emerged from the planet’s core itself, avatars of its primordial power, while others claim they are all that remains of a star-faring empire. Their devotion to mastering elemental forces has led to tales of reality-bending powers that make them both respected and feared.  
* **Values**: Balance and insight are their guiding principles. To the Nytherin, wielding their powers recklessly is an affront to the cosmic order they strive to uphold.

### **Frostwalkers**

Nomadic and enduring, the Frostwalkers navigate the glacial expanses of the Frozen Wastes with a mastery born of centuries. Their ashen-white cloaks and the faint blue glow of their ice-forged weapons mark them as specters of survival in an unforgiving land.

* **Culture**: Living in perpetual motion, Frostwalker clans follow the migrations of snow beasts and the ebb and flow of glacial rivers. Their legends tell of an ancestral pact with the spirits of ice and wind, binding their fate to the frozen lands they call home.

* **Leadership**: Leaders known as **Winterwardens** rise through feats of survival and their bond with the icy spirits. Decisions are made collectively within each clan, with the Winterwarden acting as a guide and protector.

### **Transmigrated Earthlings**

The Transmigrated Earthlings are individuals from Earth whose souls have been transported to Xylandra through the use of ancient, enigmatic relics. Upon arrival, their bodies are reconstituted by cosmic energies, shaped by their memories and physical essence. They are both alien and familiar to Xylandra, often seen as harbingers of change or as unwelcome disruptions.

* **Culture**: Transmigrated Earthlings bring fragments of Earth’s diverse cultures, values, and ingenuity to Xylandra. Though their initial shock upon arrival can be profound, many quickly adapt to their new reality. Their Earth-born knowledge often leads them to positions of influence as inventors, adventurers, or leaders. Over time, some adopt Xylandra’s ways, while others cling to their Earthly identities, blending traditions into something uniquely their own.

* **Values**: Earthlings tend to value individualism, curiosity, and adaptability, traits that serve them well in Xylandra’s hostile environment. Their ingenuity and resilience often set them apart, though their outlook can sometimes clash with the rigid traditions of Xylandra’s native peoples.

* **Conflict**: Earthlings are both envied and distrusted. Their sudden appearance through mysterious means stokes fear and awe among Xylandra’s inhabitants. Some factions see them as potential allies with unique insights, while others view them as meddling interlopers. The Merchants' Guild is particularly keen on exploiting their Earth-born knowledge, while the Order of the Void may see them as conduits for cosmic power.

* **Governance**: Earthlings have no unified governance, as each is cast into Xylandra alone. They must forge their own path, often allying with local factions or carving out independent roles as mercenaries, explorers, or scholars. Over time, informal communities of Transmigrated Earthlings may form in larger cities, bound by shared origins and mutual understanding of their unique plight.

## **Settlements**

The settlements of Xylandra rise like beacons of life amid its perilous landscapes, blending towering relics of ancient civilizations with the ingenuity of modern inhabitants. These city-states and enclaves are vibrant hubs of culture, power, and conflict, where the past and future collide in a kaleidoscope of color and mystery.

### **Ancient Technology**
