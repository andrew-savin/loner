# Western Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is dust, gunpowder, and silence — a stretch of sunburnt land where justice rides a tired horse and graves are dug with one eye open.
- The age is the fading light of the 1800s — a time when the frontier gasps its last breath before the iron rails and telegraph wires stitch it shut.
- The setting is a lonely town at the edge of the known — saloons creak at dusk, cattle trails run dry, and the nearest law rides days behind.
- Wilderness presses from all sides — jagged canyons, storm-bit plains, forests thick with eyes, and rivers that have swallowed more than they quenched.
- The town is a crossroads for fortune and ruin — ranchers, trappers, drifters, preachers, bounty men, and worse — all passing through, none passing clean.
- Life runs on grit and guts — fences built by calloused hands, whiskey poured for coin or company, and grudges carried further than water.
- Danger comes with the wind — wolves in the hills, bandits on the ridge, a stranger with a slow draw and no name to answer for.
- This is a land where every man writes his name in lead, and the only truth worth a damn is what you can hold onto when the shooting starts.

## Special Rules

### Quick-Draw Duels

In this land, justice is often decided in a heartbeat — or the failure of one.

- When a duel begins, both participants roll a **Quick-Draw** skill check.
- The winner gains **+1d on their first attack**.
- After that, combat proceeds as normal — each side takes turns making attack rolls until one is down or flees.
- A tie on the draw means both fire at once: resolve both attacks before applying consequences.

> **Note:** You can use tags like `Quick Hands`, `Fast Reflexes`, or `Gunfighter Instinct` to get advantage on the draw roll.

### Wanted Levels

A good name goes a long way in the West. A bad one goes even further.

Each time you commit crimes or notorious acts, your **Wanted Level** increases. Higher levels draw the attention of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the occasional vigilante. Good deeds may reduce your notoriety — but only if someone’s watching.

**Wanted Levels:**

1. **Unknown** – You're a nobody. Free to roam.  
2. **Petty Criminal** – You've stolen, lied, or trespassed. Some folks might take note.  
3. **Notorious Outlaw** – There's a poster with your face on it somewhere.  
4. **Infamous Gang Leader** – You're a known threat. Most towns will refuse you service or shoot on sight.  
5. **Public Enemy** – Your name spreads faster than your horse can ride. You’re hunted.  
6. **Legendary Outlaw** – You’re a living myth. The law wants your head. So does half the territory.

> **Tip:** Some towns or factions may react based on your level. At Level 3+, roll Faction Tags with Disadvantage unless disguised or protected.

### Hardship

The frontier doesn’t care about your plans. It breaks them — and you — without apology.

- You must track **thirst**, **hunger**, and **exposure**.
- When injured, healing is slow unless you have access to clean water, shelter, or proper medicine.
- Harsh conditions (drought, dust storms, blizzards) may impose penalties or force checks to continue travel or avoid Frailty Tags.

> **Example:**  
> You’re stranded on the mesa. No water, no shade. After a day’s travel, you gain the tag `Parched`. Keep it until you find water. If `Parched` is still active and you fail a survival check, gain `Delirious` or `Sunburned`.

> **Note:** Use Frailty Tags like `Starving`, `Frostbitten`, or `Exhausted` to represent long-term hardship effects.
