# Western Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is dust, gunpowder, and silence — a stretch of sunburnt land where justice rides a tired horse and graves are dug with one eye open.
- The age is the fading light of the 1800s — a time when the frontier gasps its last breath before the iron rails and telegraph wires stitch it shut.
- The setting is a lonely town at the edge of the known — saloons creak at dusk, cattle trails run dry, and the nearest law rides days behind.
- Wilderness presses from all sides — jagged canyons, storm-bit plains, forests thick with eyes, and rivers that have swallowed more than they quenched.
- The town is a crossroads for fortune and ruin — ranchers, trappers, drifters, preachers, bounty men, and worse — all passing through, none passing clean.
- Life runs on grit and guts — fences built by calloused hands, whiskey poured for coin or company, and grudges carried further than water.
- Danger comes with the wind — wolves in the hills, bandits on the ridge, a stranger with a slow draw and no name to answer for.
- This is a land where every man writes his name in lead, and the only truth worth a damn is what you can hold onto when the shooting starts.
