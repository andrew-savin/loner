# Pirates Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is ruled by tide and cannon — a storm-wracked sea of blood, gold, and betrayal where every ship sails on superstition as much as sailcloth.
- The age is the twilight of empire — the late 1600s to early 1700s — when crowns send fleets they cannot control and laws are more rumor than rule.
- The setting is the Caribbean, where jungle-choked islands rise from sapphire waters, forts crumble under the sun, and every cove might hide a rogue fleet or buried sin.
- Power is fractured and volatile — Spanish galleons patrol the trade lanes, English governors whisper to smugglers, and pirate captains carve empires from coral and gunpowder.
- Justice is a matter of aim and timing — courts are bought, navies are stretched thin, and gallows swing heavy with names no one remembers.
- Culture is wild and layered — tongues clash on every dock, drums echo in sugarcane fields, and stolen gods are prayed to under false names.
- Gold is the hunger that drives it all — chests of coin, crates of rum, charts marked with cursed Xs — enough to make a sailor king, or sink him screaming.
- The sea is freedom, but it keeps no promises — only the bold, the cruel, and the damned rise with the tide.

## Special Rules

### Ship Combat

When engaging in ship combat, resolve the scene by asking a closed question (e.g. *Do we manage to board them before they escape?*). Interpret the result with the following **fictional prompts**, not fixed effects.

* **No, and**: Your ship takes a brutal hit or is outmaneuvered. You’re left vulnerable, or damage affects a key system (e.g. sails, rudder, morale).
* **No**: The enemy ship holds position. You fail to make progress and remain under threat.
* **No, but**: You’re kept at bay, but avoid damage or find a small tactical advantage.
* **Yes, but**: You make contact or land a shot, but suffer damage or lose a key crew member.
* **Yes**: You hit them hard or gain the upper hand.
* **Yes, and**: A clean broadside, precise boarding, or swift disabling action—total advantage is yours.

> **Note:** Treat “damage” loosely—it might mean a torn sail, spilled powder, broken morale, or wounded allies. Track the fiction, not HP.

### Plunder & Morale

After a successful raid, ask: *Did the haul satisfy the crew?* or *Do we manage to keep order during the division of spoils?*

Use the result to build **emergent pressure or stability**, not binary success/failure.

* **No, and**: Fights break out over shares; a faction forms against you.
* **No**: The crew is grumbling, and trust is fraying.
* **No, but**: Unease simmers, but your officers keep order—for now.
* **Yes, but**: You get things settled, but only after giving up something or showing weakness.
* **Yes**: Order is maintained, loot distributed.
* **Yes, and**: A rousing speech, a fair hand—morale soars, you gain loyalty or volunteers.

> **Caution:** Crew morale can be tracked abstractly (via a tag, journal note, or countdown). Use it narratively to inform future rolls.

### Mutiny

When tension peaks, ask: *Does the crew rise against me?* or *Can I hold the deck in the face of open defiance?*

* **No, and**: You reassert control with force or fear. The crew falls in line—at a cost.
* **No**: The uprising is quelled. Morale is shaky, but you’re in charge.
* **No, but**: You prevent a full revolt, but the ringleaders remain, watching.
* **Yes, but**: You're deposed or forced to share power, but you avoid being cast overboard.
* **Yes**: You're overthrown. Someone else takes the helm.
* **Yes, and**: You’re betrayed by a close ally. Leadership shifts violently. You may survive—but not unscathed.

> **Tip:** Let mutinies reshape the fiction dramatically. They’re a chance to reframe the story, not a game-over.

## Locations

### Port Royal

* A thriving British colonial port, infamous for its corruption and indulgence.

* The Hidden Cavern: Said to house long-lost Spanish plunder, accessible only at low tide.
* The Clifftop Watch: An old lookout tower now used by smugglers—if they trust you.

### Tortuga

* A loose, lawless port where pirates rule and no flag flies for long.
