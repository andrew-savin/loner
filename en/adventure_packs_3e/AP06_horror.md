# Horror Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is our own, but it breathes with an undercurrent of dread. The familiar becomes suspect — creaking floorboards echo too long, cell reception fades in places it shouldn’t, and ordinary people vanish without trace. The mundane hides the monstrous, and truth is always one page, one scream, or one door away.
- The time period is the present day, grounded in contemporary life. Technology offers connection and comfort, but rarely protection. Police reports, CCTV footage, and emergency calls hint at truths too terrible to file. Bureaucracy delays the search, and no one comes when you scream in the woods.
- The location is chosen for its sense of **isolation and tension**. It could be a dying town haunted by its own history, a city where something malevolent slips through the cracks, or a rural stretch where the dark never really lifts. Wherever it is, help is far, the nights are long, and people have started acting strangely.
- Society appears stable, but anxiety simmers beneath the surface. Institutions exist — law enforcement, hospitals, universities — but they’re overworked, underfunded, and often ineffective. Local folklore, old news clippings, and whispered warnings speak of past horrors, while government cover-ups and online conspiracy forums suggest they never truly ended.
- The horror here draws on **classic and modern influences**: haunted houses, cryptid sightings, ancient cults, and the creeping rot of something forgotten returning. Every shadow may hold a secret. Every stranger may wear a mask. Every truth may be worse than the lie that buried it.
- History bleeds into the present. Stories like the **Salem witch trials**, the **Amityville haunting**, or **urban legends gone viral** lend weight to what’s happening now. Locals speak of **the Black Hollow Church**, **the Ashfield Murders**, or **the woman who never stopped crying** — stories that the protagonist soon realizes were warnings, not tales.
- Competing forces shape the hidden war beneath reality: secret government programs suppressing knowledge, cults seeking communion with unknowable forces, lone hunters scarred by past encounters, and something old and patient, just now beginning to wake.

## Special Rules

### **Fear**

Fear is not a feeling — it’s a **Conflict**. When your character faces overwhelming terror, they don’t just react — they fight to stay in control.

- When confronted by a terrifying situation — a creature, a location, an event — and your character is trying to resist panic, keep moving, or push through, **treat it as a Conflict**.  
- Roll as usual and apply the **Harm rules** — but instead of taking physical damage, **Fear reduces your Luck**.
- Tags like *Composed Under Pressure* or *Panics in Silence* apply as they would in any other Conflict, granting **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**.
- The key difference: **Luck lost to Fear cannot be recovered** through resting or normal healing scenes.
- To recover Luck lost to Fear, your character must **retreat to a safe, emotionally grounded place** — somewhere that reminds them who they are. This can be a literal home, a symbolic space, or a moment of true safety with someone they trust.

### **Insanity**

When the veil lifts and the mind glimpses what lies beyond, the damage is deeper than fear — it is existential.

- Any **direct exposure to the Supernatural** (ritual anomalies, cognitohazards, time fractures, unfiltered alien contact, or reality-warping phenomena) triggers a **Sanity check**.
- Ask the Oracle: *"Does my mind withstand the encounter?"*
- If the result is unfavorable, **apply the Harm rules**, but to **Sanity**, not Luck.
- Unlike Fear, this is not a Conflict — there is no contest. This is the mind breaking under the weight of the incomprehensible.
- **Sanity does not recover naturally**. It can only be restored through:
  - **Closure**: resolving what caused the fracture.
  - **Ritual grounding**: personal, cultural, or symbolic.
  - **Human connection**: someone believing you, helping you make sense of it.
- If Sanity reaches **zero**, the character is no longer in control. Their fate is shaped by what broke them — fugue states, delusions, possession, catatonia, or worse.
