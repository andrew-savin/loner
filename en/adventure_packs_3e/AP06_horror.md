## Special Rules

- **Fear**: characters will face terrifying and stressful situations that will test their bravery and mental fortitude. Fear consumes your Luck. When you face otherworldly creatures, you can't recover as in a regular conflict! You're paralyzed with terror and you must retire in a family environment to recover.
- **Insanity**: The horrors that the characters will face may take a toll on their mental stability. Keep track of your Sanity as you do for Luck. Every time you face the Supernatural, ask the Oracle how your psyche reacts. Then apply the Harm rules. If Sanity reaches zero you've lost your mind.
