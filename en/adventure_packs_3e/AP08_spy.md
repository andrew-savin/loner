# Spy Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is a maze of codes, cover identities, and poisoned trust — a place where truth is currency and no one is ever who they seem to be.
- The time is Cold War silence, wartime shadows, or the digital now — history’s thresholds where secrets shape nations and silence saves lives.
- The setting shifts with the mission — smoke-filled embassies, snowbound borders, desert compounds, war-torn capitals, and private clubs that never appear on maps.
- History breathes beneath the surface — proxy wars, shifting alliances, revolutions in slow motion — all weaponized by those who work in whispers.
- Espionage agencies maneuver like predators in a shrinking cage — CIA, MI6, KGB, Mossad, or specters of fiction, each with their own scars, saints, and sins.
- Technology follows the pulse of the era — hidden wires, microfilm, dead drops, burner networks, satellite pings, and black-market firmware running in borrowed skin.
- Loyalty is fluid, allegiance negotiable, and betrayal inevitable — every agent is a ghost in someone’s file, and the truth never stays clean for long.
- This world has no neutral ground. Every move is a message, and every message is a risk.

## Special Rules

### Cover Identity

Your character begins each mission with an assigned cover. When performing an action that might expose your cover, roll the Oracle with **Risk**. If the Oracle response is negative or mixed, your cover begins to fray.

* Track cover using **three states**: *Intact*, *Strained*, *Blown*.
* Each time you act “out of cover,” or draw heat, consult the Oracle and adjust the state.
* A *Blown* cover immediately triggers **extraction, pursuit, or capture** (Oracle decides which).

> **Tip**
> Describe how your action fits the cover — not just what you do, but **how you make it look normal**.

### Interrogation

If captured, you enter an **interrogation sequence**. You must answer questions posed by your captors. For each question:

* You may choose to **Lie**, **Evade**, or **Confess**.
* Consult the Oracle after each attempt. On a failure, your captors learn something — real or fabricated, Oracle decides.
* After three questions, roll to see if you’re **released**, **escape**, or remain **detained**.

> **Note**
> If you plant disinformation during interrogation, note it — it may alter future missions if the lie takes root.

### Political Tensions

Each mission alters the geopolitical climate. After a mission:

* Roll the Oracle to determine whether your actions **stabilized**, **disrupted**, or **escalated** tensions.
* Keep a simple **Tension Track**: *Stable → Shifting → Boiling Point*.
* At *Boiling Point*, missions become more chaotic: assets disappear, contacts are unreliable, and extraction becomes harder.

> **Tip**
> Use factions or governments as recurring actors. When you cross one, track their suspicion.

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | Infiltrate a diplomatic gala and extract a defector hiding in plain sight — before their cover collapses. |
| 12  | A forged memo sparks a scandal. Retrieve the original document before it reaches the press.               |
| 13  | Your former handler resurfaces with a job and no explanation. Say yes, or risk losing your identity.      |
| 14  | A data vault hidden in a shuttered bookstore may hold the truth behind a blacklisted operation.           |
| 15  | Steal a prototype listening device from an ally’s embassy — then decide who gets it.                      |
| 16  | The safehouse is compromised. Burn the evidence, but someone inside may not be who they claim.            |
| 21  | Surveillance footage shows you at a crime scene — but you were never there. Prove it.                     |
| 22  | A ghost agent transmits from a dead network. Trace the signal before it disappears again.                 |
| 23  | A staged hostage rescue masks a smuggling op. You're sent in — but to stop which part?                    |
| 24  | The mole you unmasked has vanished. Your contact insists they were never real.                            |
| 25  | A message hidden in a vintage broadcast suggests a war-era asset is still active — and watching you.      |
| 26  | A poisoned official collapses mid-speech. You have 12 hours to trace the vector before you're blamed.     |
| 31  | An encrypted case was dropped in the wrong dead drop. Retrieve it before rival handlers act.              |
| 32  | You’re hired to tail a diplomat. They’re already tailing someone else — and so are you.                   |
| 33  | The target is a child born into a fabricated identity. Extract them, or erase the file.                   |
| 34  | A former asset demands protection — in exchange for blackmail material you didn’t know existed.           |
| 35  | Your cover ID receives an official invitation to a secret summit. You weren’t supposed to be known.       |
| 36  | A routine brush pass transfers a drive. It contains footage of your last unsanctioned kill.               |
| 41  | Sabotage an arms deal between two factions — but don’t let either know it was you.                        |
| 42  | A deep-cover operative breaks silence. Their voice sounds like someone you trusted and buried.            |
| 43  | A faction wants you to plant intel on a rival. Another pays you to intercept it. Both are watching.       |
| 44  | The airport is locked down. One passenger has classified tech in their luggage. Guess who.                |
| 45  | You’re offered immunity in exchange for a list of active agents — including your current identity.        |
| 46  | A package arrives addressed to your alias. Inside: your real birth certificate and a listening device.    |
| 51  | A foreign news outlet publishes details from a mission you haven’t completed yet. Find the leak.          |
| 52  | Your mission: escort a scientist across hostile territory. They insist you're part of an experiment.      |
| 53  | A key witness is being held in an asylum. They speak only in Cold War ciphers.                            |
| 54  | A minor bureaucrat is too well-informed. Dig into their past before they dig into yours.                  |
| 55  | A rogue satellite comes online. It has your old team's encrypted logs — and someone’s using them.         |
| 56  | You’ve been framed for an assassination. The evidence is airtight — and planted by your own side.         |
| 61  | An encrypted letter arrives weekly, signed by someone who died in a botched mission you led.              |
| 62  | An underground courier service moves secrets for hire. Infiltrate it without being archived.              |
| 63  | A defector’s memoirs contain details only you should know. Redact the book — or its author.               |
| 64  | A facial recognition algorithm tags you in surveillance footage from six years ago — on the wrong side.   |
| 65  | A ghost file resurfaces in the archive: classified under your real name. You never wrote it.              |
| 66  | Someone is impersonating you across three countries. Trace them — or become them.                         |
