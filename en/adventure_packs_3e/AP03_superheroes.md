# Superheroes Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is shaped by the presence of individuals known as *supers*, *metahumans*, and *vigilantes*—those born, changed, enhanced, or cursed with abilities that defy known science or logic.
- The timeline is the present day, but history diverged long ago. Superhuman incidents have left scars on the world: collapsed cities, erased timelines, and buried truths governments won't admit to.
- Locations range from towering neon-lit supercities and crumbling neighborhoods abandoned after metahuman conflicts, to secret labs beneath the ice, interdimensional echoes of past events, and fortress-prisons in orbit.
- Society is fractured by the superhuman question. Some idolize heroes; others demand registration, regulation, or exile. Legislation like the *Metahuman Registration Act* or *Zero Tolerance Zones* reflect the ongoing tension between freedom and control.
- Supers are not new. This is a world with generational heroes and legacies—golden-age icons now in decline, second-generation proteges under pressure, and outlawed third-generation metahumans born after catastrophic events.
- Key themes include:  
  - **The burden of power** — What do you owe the world just because you're stronger?  
  - **Public masks vs. private cost** — The hero’s image is curated; the toll is personal.  
  - **Control and rebellion** — Who decides how power should be used?  
  - **Broken legacies** — What if the past heroes were wrong? What if you're their mistake?  
  - **The myth of justice** — What justice means in a world of secret wars, corporate heroes, and propaganda is up for debate.

## Special Rules

> *"With great power comes great complication."* — Every action has weight in a world shaped by supers. These special rules reflect the dramatic highs, brutal costs, and cinematic moments that define solo superhero stories.

### Signature Power Surge

Once per mission, when the protagonist uses a **signature power** in a context where it would dramatically shift the scene, you may declare a **Power Surge**.  
- Skip the Oracle entirely. The result is an automatic **“Yes, and…”**, narrated as a flashy, awe-inspiring moment.  
- Afterward, the protagonist gains the **“Drained”** condition until they can rest or recover.

> *Example: The Tempest channels a city-wide storm to disable a fleet of drones. Power Surge activated — drones down in a flash, but he's left reeling, off-balance, and vulnerable.*

### Hero Points

The protagonist begins each adventure with **3 Hero Points**. These represent not just luck, but *willpower, improvisation, and the unstoppable drive to do what’s right*.

You may spend 1 Hero Point to:
- **Re-roll** an unfavorable result.
- **Ask a question with advantage**, even when normally rolling at a disadvantage.
- **Ignore a frailty or condition** for one scene.
- **Stagger dramatically instead of falling** when a twist or failure would otherwise remove you from action.

Hero Points **refresh at the start of a new adventure** or after a scene of deep rest, healing, or personal reconnection (even a dramatic rooftop monologue will do).

### Public Perception

Superheroes live under scrutiny. At the end of key scenes, you may roll 1d6 to check how your recent actions shifted public opinion. This affects future events, opportunities, and even Oracle rolls involving civilians or institutions.

| Roll | Public Response           |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Fear and backlash         |
| 2–3  | Mistrust and uncertainty  |
| 4–5  | Supportive but divided    |
| 6    | Celebrated and admired    |

You may optionally track **Reputation** as a tag that changes over time.

### Collateral Tags

During dramatic or large-scale scenes, introduce **Collateral Tags** to locations or situations that reflect unintended consequences of superhuman actions.  
These can then be used as **risk factors**, **story prompts**, or **scene complications**.

> *Examples: “Downtown in Rubble,” “Citizens Trapped in Fire,” “News Drone Watching,” “Power Grid Unstable.”*

## Locations

### Metropia  
- A sprawling, vertical megacity where neon-lit towers rise above neglected districts. Once the capital of superhero optimism, now fragmented between corporate heroes, unsanctioned vigilantes, and underground factions.  
- It is a pressure cooker of surveillance, social unrest, and hyper-commercialized justice.  
- **Possible encounters**:  
  - A rooftop chase disrupted by a rogue drone swarm  
  - A protest spiraling out of control after metahuman interference  
  - A corrupted superteam marketing its new energy drink

### Jiston City  
- A collapsing industrial stronghold where forgotten villains retire and upstart crime families experiment with unstable tech.  
- Martial law is unofficial, but enforced by private security outfits with flexible ethics.  
- **Possible encounters**:  
  - A black market auction of confiscated superweapons  
  - An underground cage match between ex-sidekicks  
  - A metahuman gang war that spills into residential zones

### Central City  
- The polished face of a world that’s long since fractured—famous, functional, and quietly boiling underneath.  
- Wealthy elites, celebrity heroes, and policy-makers all share the same skyline.  
- **Possible encounters**:  
  - A political fundraiser attacked mid-broadcast  
  - A corporate hero accused of lethal misconduct  
  - A reality-bending tourist from a "sister city" in another timeline

### The Harmony Post  
- A media behemoth with ties to every faction. While it claims journalistic integrity, it also runs security contracts, deepfakes, and damage control campaigns.  
- Heroes both dread and depend on its reach.  
- **Possible encounters**:  
  - A whistleblower hiding in the server basement  
  - An AI journalist who’s gone rogue  
  - An exposé about the protagonist being prepped for broadcast

### Vortex Island  
- A remote island fortress protected by orbit-linked defense grids and time-lock perimeter zones.  
- Official HQ of The Concord and host to political summits, high-risk containment cells, and secret testing of next-gen power dampeners.  
- **Possible encounters**:  
  - A breakout from Cell Zero during a diplomatic event  
  - An unauthorized clone discovered mid-training  
  - A telepathic security sweep revealing your suppressed memories

### Crimson Castle  
- A gothic-tech academy built into an isolated mountain range. It serves as sanctuary, school, and proving ground for unstable or high-risk mutants.  
- Its founder, Red Crane, vanished ten years ago. Some say she’s still watching.  
- **Possible encounters**:  
  - A forbidden wing of the school opens for the first time in years  
  - A student undergoes a sudden, catastrophic secondary mutation  
  - A rival institution attempts a covert recruitment (or extraction) mission
