# Cyberpunk Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is steel, static, and surveillance — a corporate dystopia where freedom is a marketing term and every breath is logged in a database you can’t see.
- The age is a broken future — governments are ghosts, replaced by contracts and firewalls, and the streets answer only to those who pay in blood or bandwidth.
- The setting is a neon-drenched megacity — towers scrape the clouds, alleys stink of oil and ozone, and light never quite reaches the ground.
- Bodies are currency — cybernetic implants are everywhere, from high-end augment suites to junk-tier grafts that spark and fail under strain.
- Virtual reality is more real than the meat — a labyrinth of digital sanctuaries and trapdoors, ruled by rogue AIs, corporate censors, and whispering code.
- Power is fractured and predatory — megacorps rule from chrome citadels, gangs control the gutters, and insurgent nodes crack systems no one admits exist.
- Identity is malleable, truth is encrypted, and memory is a service with monthly fees — who you are depends on who still has the data.
- This is a world where survival means picking a side, faking a name, and never staying still — because the grid is always watching, and mercy isn't in the code.

## Special Rules

### Hacking

The grid is a battlefield. If you jack in, you’d better be ready to bleed—digitally or otherwise.

* **Access**: You need a terminal. Physical or wireless, public or ghosted, legit or jerry-rigged. Get in first.
* **Actions**: Upload malware. Steal intel. Rewrite access. Shut down security. Hijack drones. Every command is a test of skill—or software.
* **Failure**: Alerts. ICE. Blacklists. Traces. Physical feedback. Sometimes, just a full brainburn and your name on a bounty board.
* **Detection**: If they notice you, the system fights back. Alarms trigger, contracts update, enemies deploy.
* **Success**: Information. Control. Leverage. You might turn the tide of a job—or blow open a hidden truth. Just don’t get cocky.

> **TIP**: High-risk hacks should feel like tense heists. Add pressure. Add noise. Let the grid feel alive and hostile.

### Cybernetic Enhancements

Cyberware is freedom—but it bites. Every implant is a deal: more power, more risk, less of the original you.

* **Installation**: Found in street clinics, off-grid labs, or stolen from corpses. The best gear is black-market.
* **Benefits**: Strength boosts. Reflex spikes. Sensor suites. Direct hacking access. You become faster, sharper, deadlier.
* **Maintenance**: Cyberware needs tune-ups. Glitches, lag, pain loops—these happen. Clinics fix it, if you pay.
* **Risks**: Side effects are real. Emotional desync, addiction to overclockers, or getting tagged by trackers in your own blood.
* **Limits**: You can’t run too hot for too long. Stack too many mods, and systems clash. EMPs fry you. Hackers hijack you.

> **CAUTION**: Use cyberware as leverage—not a crutch. Let it change who the character is, not just what they can do.

### Implants

Treat these as gear entries, lootable or installable between jobs.

* **Neural Interface** — Direct mind-machine link; remote control, instant sync, total immersion.
* **Cybernetic Eyes** — IR, zoom, night-vision, threat highlights. Seeing is exploiting.
* **Cybernetic Limbs** — Lift more. Run faster. Crush bones. Looks? Optional.
* **Neural Implant** — Boosted memory, logic circuits, skill caching.
* **Voice Modulator** — Speak in any voice, any accent. Even ones that shouldn’t exist.
* **Retinal Display** — Augmented-reality HUD burned right into your vision.
* **Subdermal Armor** — Not visible. Very real. Stops knives and low-caliber rounds.
* **Cybernetic Organs** — Internal hardware upgrades: cleaner blood, stronger lungs, rewired guts.
* **Pain Suppressor** — Numb it all. Until the body gives out anyway.
* **Adrenal Boost** — Triggered surge. Superhuman for ten seconds. Then you crash.
* **Synthetic Blood** — Enhanced oxygenation. More stamina, faster healing, less downtime.
* **Bio-Monitor** — Health alerts, drug tracking, full vitals suite.
* **Reflex Booster** — Shaves milliseconds off reactions. Time enough to live.
* **Sensory Enhancement** — Hearing ultrasounds. Smelling lies. Tasting poison.
* **Cybernetic Spine** — Reinforced backbone. Literally.
* **Subdermal Weapon** — Hidden blade, gun, or dart—where scanners won’t see it.
* **Datajack** — Skull port. Plug in. Hack faster. Burn harder.
* **Cybernetic Heart** — Tougher, faster, longer-lasting. It beats when you shouldn’t.

> **NOTE**: Characters with implants may occasionally trigger suspicion, scanners, or corporate interest—especially if running rare or military-grade mods.

### Reputation

In this world, reputation is currency. It's also a tracking variable.

* **Gain It**: Pull off high-profile runs. Leak corporate secrets. Wipe out a rival crew on livefeed.
* **Lose It**: Screw up. Get caught. Sell out to the wrong bidder. Ghost a job you were paid for.
* **Spend It**: Reputation gets you in the door—exclusive locations, favors, elite contacts.
* **Suffer It**: The higher you rise, the more you’re watched. Fame paints a target.

**Reputation Levels**:

* **Unknown** — Nobody cares. You’re safe. You’re replaceable.
* **Local** — Known in a neighborhood or among a gang.
* **Regional** — Your name echoes through factions and feeds.
* **National** — Major players recognize your work.
* **International** — You’ve gone global. Corps whisper your handle.
* **Legendary** — You’re a myth in a world that doesn’t believe in them.

> **TIP**: Let reputation shift dynamically. Make it a double-edged sword—useful, dangerous, always evolving.
