# Fantasy Adventure Pack

- The world is a realm of ancient mystery and living myth, where enchanted forests shift overnight, and echoes of old gods linger in the wind. Forgotten places stir with purpose, and magic weaves through every shadow and glimmer.
- The time period resembles a late-medieval fantasy age, marked by crumbling empires, feuding dynasties, and the slow return of forces thought buried. Castles rise on dragon-haunted hills, and relics of the past rewrite the present.
- The location is a fragmented kingdom called **Aldorath**, a land of rolling hills, cursed ruins, moonlit marshes, and jagged mountain ranges. Power is split among ancient houses, each ruling their province from keeps laced with intrigue. The capital, **Eldrida**, is both a beacon of order and a nest of secrets.
- The people of Aldorath include humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, and stranger folk touched by old magic. Tensions rise as borders blur, old alliances strain, and ancient pacts fray. Each people clings to fading traditions or forges dangerous new paths.
- Magic is primal, beautiful, and volatile. It is channeled by wizards, witches, and hedge mystics, and loosely regulated by the **College of Wizards**, an increasingly divided authority that clings to relevance while suppressing arcane threats.
- The kingdom faces growing peril: foreign agents stir civil unrest, outlaws rule the wilds, and dark magic seeps from the cracks beneath the land. Myths once whispered now walk in daylight.
- Competing factions shape the kingdom’s fate: the fractured monarchy, ambitious noble houses, a paranoid College of Wizards, outlaw cults, exiled heirs, and secret orders that seek to awaken what should remain forgotten.

## Special Rule: Magic

A character may channel their **Luck** to cast spells or activate magical abilities. Each spell has a specific **Luck cost**, which varies based on its power or complexity. To cast a spell, the protagonist spends the required amount of Luck and rolls the Oracle to determine the outcome:

- **No and**: The spell fails catastrophically — and something else goes wrong.
- **No**: The spell fails, and the Luck spent is lost.
- **No but**: The spell fails, but the Luck is not expended.
- **Yes but**: The spell succeeds, but with a complication, side effect, or unintended cost.
- **Yes**: The spell succeeds as intended.
- **Yes and**: The spell succeeds with an extra benefit — such as a bonus effect, lasting impact, or unexpected insight.

**Luck used for spellcasting refreshes** after the character takes a proper rest in a safe place. During a Conflict, the current Luck total applies for the duration and resets when the Conflict ends, as per the core rules.

## Locations

### Eldrida (The Thorn-Crowned Capital)

- The jewel of Aldorath, where spires and domes rise behind fortified walls. Home to the **Crown of Thorns**, the **Severed Circle**, and the last remaining Temple of the Hollow Flame. Its streets are crowded with masked envoys, relic smugglers, and whispering spies.  
- Beneath its surface lie catacombs older than the kingdom, sealed and forgotten by decree.  
- Possible encounters: **King Vaelor**, **Keeper Ysryn**, **Magister Syrenth in disguise**, agents of the **Vault of Echoes**

### The Dragon’s Spire

- A scorched peak wreathed in stormclouds. The lair of an **Elder Wyrm**, its hoard buried in molten stone and bone. Fabled as one of the Seven Watchers who once ruled the skies in the First Age.  
- Few reach the peak — fewer return.  
- Possible encounters: The **Elder Wyrm**, relic-thirsty knights of the **Wyrmglaive Compact**, cursed echoes of past challengers

### The Forest of Shadowroot

- Twisted trees, half-alive, grow over ruined altars and moss-cloaked idols. Here, the **Briar Assembly** whispers to beasts and root-spirits. The deeper paths shift, and time itself feels wrong beneath the canopy.  
- Many believe the forest watches intruders. Some say it remembers.  
- Possible encounters: **Mother Talia**, **Medusa**, **Pale Wraith**, roaming goblins, lost pilgrims

### Blackwood Hollow

- Not a castle, but a **cracked and brooding manor** perched over a sinkhole. Lord Blackwood is long dead, but **his bloodline was never ended** — and his spirit may yet speak.  
- The Hollow is both a haunted estate and a political ruin.  
- Possible encounters: **Descendants of the Blackwood Pact**, **Wraiths**, secret cults of the **Thornless Pact**

### The Severed Circle (College of Wizards)

- Once the great tower of the unified College, now fractured into rival arcane halls. Forbidden sections are chained shut, while magical constructs patrol the old vaults.  
- The **Umbral Synod** was exiled from here — but some say their agents remain.  
- Possible encounters: **Archmage Alaric’s successor**, ambitious students, secretive keepers of the **Vault of Echoes**

### The Vaulted Ruins of Rhygir

- Deep in the earth, overgrown and collapsed, lie the remnants of the **pre-collapse civilization** that once ruled Aldorath. Wards still flicker, though the architects are long dead.  
- It’s said even the **Vault of Echoes** fears what lies at its core.  
- Possible encounters: **Orc warbands**, **Blight-Risen**, relic guardians, **Vel Harrowglass’s agents**, traps that whisper
