# Mystery Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is cloaked in fog, soot, and silence — a realm of gaslight and deception, where every step echoes with secrets and nothing wears its true face.
- The time is a brittle hinge between ages, where horse-drawn carriages give way to steam and steel, and the rules of old no longer hold fast.
- The setting is **Victorian London**, a city of crumbling grandeur and restless ambition, where empire casts long shadows and crime blooms beneath the cobblestones.
- Society teeters on the edge — class divides blur, science challenges faith, and the line between progress and peril grows thin with every new invention.
- Detectives walk this uncertain world like half-mythic figures — thinkers, hunters, liars — cutting through illusion with intuition and blood.
- Mystery is everywhere: in the locked room, the vanished heir, the laughing corpse, the trembling maid. Nothing arrives without a cost, and every clue is a coin spent in doubt.
- Stories draw from Doyle, Poe, and the ink-stained chronicles of a world trying to explain itself before it falls apart.
- Themes spiral through guilt, corruption, obsession, and truth — not just in the crimes solved, but in the ones we choose to ignore.

## Special Rules

### **Clues**  
Every mystery leaves traces in its wake. To peel back the layers of deceit and reach the truth, your character must gather fragments of information — whispered gossip, half-burned notes, overlooked fingerprints — and assemble them into something coherent.  

When attempting to uncover a clue, ask a closed question and interpret the result as follows:  
- **"No, and..."**: The trail is cold. Nothing surfaces — not even a red herring.  
- **"No"**: Something surfaces, but it’s little more than background noise — a detail of no real consequence.  
- **"No, but..."**: You find something... but it deceives. A clue that points in the wrong direction.  
- **"Yes, but..."**: You find a real clue — but it’s incomplete, distorted, or buried in noise. Further legwork is required.  
- **"Yes"**: A clear and useful piece of information emerges. A thread that can be followed.  
- **"Yes, and..."**: The investigation leaps forward. A cache of insight, a breakthrough — something that rewrites the board.

### **Interrogation**  
People lie. They withhold. They break under pressure or hide behind smiles. When questioning a suspect or witness, every word must be weighed, every glance watched. Interrogation is a duel — not of blades, but of patience, perception, and precision.  

When questioning someone, ask a closed question and consult the result:  
- **"No, and..."**: The suspect shuts down completely. The door slams shut.  
- **"No"**: They offer scraps — vague, unrelated, useless.  
- **"No, but..."**: They lead you astray, deliberately or not. A lie wrapped in truth.  
- **"Yes, but..."**: The truth emerges — but slowly, and through resistance. You’ll need to work harder to make sense of it.  
- **"Yes"**: They talk. The details make sense. Something valuable comes through.  
- **"Yes, and..."**: They spill more than intended — one thread, then another. Suddenly, the whole picture begins to shift.

### **Alibis**  
Everyone has a story. Whether it holds up under scrutiny is another matter. Some will offer details too perfect. Others will be vague in the places that matter most. It's your job to test those stories — to verify alibis, or to unpick the lies woven into them.  

When checking an alibi, ask a closed question and interpret the outcome:  
- **"No, and..."**: The alibi crumbles before you can confirm a single detail. Nothing adds up.  
- **"No"**: The story can’t be verified, but it doesn’t appear to matter — yet.  
- **"No, but..."**: You fail to confirm the alibi, but stumble onto something misleading — a false trail.  
- **"Yes, but..."**: The alibi checks out... mostly. But something in the way it fits is too neat, or raises other questions.  
- **"Yes"**: The alibi holds. It’s solid, plausible, and backed by fact.  
- **"Yes, and..."**: The alibi not only checks out, it sheds light on something else — a hidden motive, a second suspect, an unexpected connection.

### **Evidence**  
Blood stains. Scratched floorboards. Fibers clinging to a cuff. The world leaves traces — even when a killer tries to erase them. Your task is to find those traces, read them, and understand what they mean.  

When collecting or analyzing physical evidence, ask a closed question and apply the result:  
- **"No, and..."**: You find nothing. Worse, you may have disturbed the scene.  
- **"No"**: You uncover something — but it’s mundane, or unrelated.  
- **"No, but..."**: You uncover something that appears meaningful… but points you the wrong way.  
- **"Yes, but..."**: You find something solid, but it’s partial — unclear, damaged, or out of context.  
- **"Yes"**: The evidence is clear, usable, and directly advances the case.  
- **"Yes, and..."**: Not only is the evidence decisive — it reveals connections, accelerates conclusions, or opens entirely new leads.
