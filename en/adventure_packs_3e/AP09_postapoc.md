# Post-Apocalyptic Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- This setting takes place 50 years after a catastrophic event.
- The location is North America, specifically the Midwest region of the United States.
- The cause of the Apocalypse was a sudden and massive solar flare caused widespread power outages and destroyed much of the world's technology and infrastructure.
- The population has been drastically reduced, and many of the survivors have banded together in small communities to share resources and protect themselves from the dangers of the new world. Traditional societal structures have broken down, and new power structures have emerged. Bartering and trade have become the primary means of exchange, and the concept of ownership has been redefined.
- Resources are scarce, and the survivors must scavenge for food, water, and other necessities. Technology has regressed to pre-industrial levels, but some relics of the old world remain. The most valuable resources are fuel, medicine, and clean water.
