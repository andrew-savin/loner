# Crime Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world is stitched together by secrets, favors, and encrypted silence — a place where cameras blink like insects and every kindness is a transaction waiting to turn.
- The time is now, or something close to it — a present blurred by screens and sleeplessness, where systems grow too big to fight and too hollow to trust.
- The setting is a **fractured cityscape**, watched by drones and ruled by contracts, where syndicates sign NDAs and disappearances are logged with timestamps and polite denials.
- Power flows through backdoors and burner phones, and trust is the rarest currency — offered slow, spent fast, and never without collateral.
- Crime is layered and intimate — a fusion of hustle, hunger, and network latency. Nothing is clean, just practiced, rehearsed, and monetized.
- Identities are worn like masks, discarded when burned — killers deliver groceries, whistleblowers vanish in firewalls, and loyalty lasts until the next download.
- Law enforcement is brittle and blurred — bought, borrowed, or just too exhausted to matter. Some serve syndicates, some serve ideals, most serve the clock.
- This world doesn’t want justice. It wants leverage — and your story begins when someone pulls the wrong string.

## Special Rules

### Heat

Every action leaves a trace — a camera missed, a name overheard, a pattern noticed. Heat is the invisible pressure building around the protagonist as their operations draw the attention of law enforcement, rival crews, or someone worse. You can’t avoid heat forever — only manage it.

When your actions could raise suspicion, **ask a closed question**. Interpret the outcome as follows:

1. **No, and...**: Your moves light up alarms across departments. Cops are on your trail, and someone else just got your name.  
2. **No**: You’ve been made — police eyes are narrowing in.  
3. **No, but...**: You dodge the badge, but another crew clocks your hustle.  
4. **Yes, but...**: You stay off the radar, but the measures you took raised other eyebrows.  
5. **Yes**: You keep it clean — no tails, no whispers.  
6. **Yes, and...**: Not only do you stay invisible, but your finesse earns quiet respect from both sides of the line.

### Influence

No one survives alone. Whether you're dealing with a fixer, a lieutenant, or a dirty city council rep, **relationships are currency**. Influence determines who has your back, who feeds you intel, and who turns a blind eye when it counts.

#### Building Relationships

When trying to establish trust or ties with a new faction or contact, **ask a closed question**:

1. **No, and...**: It backfires — they now see you as a threat or nuisance.  
2. **No**: No trust, no traction. The door stays closed.  
3. **No, but...**: You’re shut out — but catch a glimpse of how they operate.  
4. **Yes, but...**: You make a connection, but it’s fragile — they’ll want more.  
5. **Yes**: You earn trust. The line is open.  
6. **Yes, and...**: They not only welcome you in, but toss you a favor to prove it.

#### Maintaining Relationships

Even solid ties erode without care. When trying to keep a relationship stable:

1. **No, and...**: Trust collapses — they turn hostile or walk away.  
2. **No**: You’re ghosted. Nothing changes, and that silence grows.  
3. **No, but...**: Still distant, but you learn something from the static.  
4. **Yes, but...**: The bond holds, but it takes sweat — or sacrifice.  
5. **Yes**: Things stay good. Business as usual.  
6. **Yes, and...**: You reinforce the bond and get something unexpected in return.

#### Gaining Information

When tapping contacts for intel:

1. **No, and...**: No answers, and now they’re spooked — or pissed.  
2. **No**: No usable info. You hit a wall.  
3. **No, but...**: You walk away empty, but spot a thread worth pulling.  
4. **Yes, but...**: You get intel — partial, outdated, or incomplete.  
5. **Yes**: You get exactly what you need.  
6. **Yes, and...**: The info is solid — and they offer backup, access, or protection.

### Interrogation

Getting someone to talk — or break — isn’t just about pressure. It’s about reading them, cornering them, or saying exactly what they feared you’d say. When extracting information from a suspect, source, or ally under stress:

1. **No, and...**: They shut down, dig in, and maybe call for help.  
2. **No**: Stonewall. They give you nothing.  
3. **No, but...**: You don’t get what you wanted — but you get a sliver of something else.  
4. **Yes, but...**: They talk — but it costs them, and they might resent it.  
5. **Yes**: They talk. You get what you came for.  
6. **Yes, and...**: They open up fully — and tell you something you didn’t even know to ask.
