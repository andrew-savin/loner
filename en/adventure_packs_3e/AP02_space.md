# Space Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The galaxy is a shattered expanse of lost empires, rogue transmissions, and derelict relics orbiting dead suns — a place where hyperspace scars the void and forgotten gods drift in low orbit.
- The age is post-imperial and uneasy — a time of broken treaties, collapsing alliances, and outlaw fleets carving dominion into stellar debris.
- The setting is **Orion Station Delta**, a labyrinthine outpost tethered to a gas giant’s magnetic field, where smugglers, diplomats, spies, and scavengers trade lies and plasma charges.
- Civilization clings to forgotten tech and failing codes — AI cults resurrect dead satellites, flesh-augmented pilgrims chase signal ghosts, and starships whisper as they pass through fractured space.
- Culture fractures along species lines, ideological codes, and ancient software — every handshake hides a contract, and every contract hides a clause.
- Factions rule from behind tinted visors — megacorps enforce silence with orbital cannons, pirate legions mark routes in blood, and archivist enclaves barter with truths too old to verify.
- Law is a matter of jurisdiction, and jurisdiction is a matter of reach — in the Outer Fracture, every ruling ends with a warning shot.
- The stars are not silent. They remember. And sometimes, they answer back.
