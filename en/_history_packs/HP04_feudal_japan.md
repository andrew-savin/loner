# Part II Setting Information 

## Culture and Society

### **1. Social Structure:**

- **Rigid class system** with samurai warriors at the top, followed by peasants, artisans, and merchants. The classes were hereditary.

- **Samurai** were the warrior nobility who served the daimyō lords. Samurai lived by the code of bushido and wielded power over the lower classes. 

- **Peasants** included farmers, fishermen, and rural villagers. Peasants produced food and goods but had limited rights. They were bound to the land and required permission to travel or marry.

- **Artisans** specialized in skilled crafts like carpentry, swordsmithing, textiles and pottery. Artisans had higher status than peasants but were still commoners.

- **Merchants** resided mostly in cities and included traders, moneylenders, and shopkeepers. Merchants were technically the lowest class, but they could gain wealth and influence. 

- **Women** held subordinate status in this patriarchal society. Wives and daughters were expected to obey male heads of household. Some exceptions included female warriors and women from samurai families who could inherit property.

- **Outcast classes** like the burakumin were shunned and faced discrimination in employment and housing.

The rigid hierarchy reinforced feudal roles and obligations in a system that favored the samurai class. Social mobility was limited, though some merchants and artisans found ways to elevate their station.

### **2. Religion:**

- **Blend of Shinto and Buddhism** characterized the religious landscape, with some Christian influences arriving later. 

- **Shinto** is the indigenous folk religion centered around reverence for kami spirits associated with natural features like mountains and rivers. Ritual purity and offerings at shrines were important practices. Amaterasu, the sun goddess, was the principal Shinto deity.

- **Buddhism** arrived from China and took root alongside Shinto. Zen Buddhism appealed to the samurai class. Monasteries and monks played an influential role. Rituals like meditation, sutra chanting and mandala creation were common practices.  

- **Christianity** arrived with European traders and missionaries. Seen as a threat, Christianity was banned, driving converts underground. 

- **Religion guided morality and worldview**. Shinto underscored harmony with nature. Buddhism emphasized detachment and impermanence. Bushido's warrior ethos aligned with Zen austerity.

- **Temples and shrines held power and meaning**. They were both spiritual and political centers. Control of famous sites was contested between warring clans.

The blend of faiths permeated daily life and culture. Religious beliefs shaped political developments, governed acceptable behavior, motivated artistic expressions, and connected the mortal realm to the divine.

## Geography

In this section, we will explore the geographical aspects of the setting, providing essential information about the general landscape, significant places, regions, and modes of travel available in the specific historical period.

### **1. General Description:**

- **Mountainous volcanic archipelago** made up of four main islands and over 6,800 smaller islands. 

- **Dramatic and varied landscapes** including high mountains like Mount Fuji, dense forests, agricultural plains, rugged coastlines and long beaches.

- **Abundant rainfall** supports lush vegetation like bamboo groves, pine forests, plum trees, and rice paddies.

- **Typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis** and volcanic eruptions pose natural hazards reflecting the volatile geology.

- **Iconic wildlife** includes monkeys, cranes, sea turtles, foxes, and bears. Mythological creatures like the kitsune (fox spirit), oni (ogre), and kappa (water sprite) feature in folklore.  

- **Strategic capitals** formed around natural harbors and bays, with access to fertile lands and trade routes. Centralized authority relied on controlling key ports, roads and mountain passes.

The archipelago's natural abundance yet frequent hazards profoundly shaped its inhabitants' worldviews. The maritime geography facilitated cultural exchange while periods of isolationism fostered uniqueness.

### **2. Main Places and Regions:**

- **Kyoto** - Imperial capital and center of aristocratic culture. Site of imperial palace, temples like Kinkakuji, and the Gion geisha district.

- **Seto Inland Sea** - Strategic maritime route with prosperous port towns. Piracy and sea battles occurred in its waters.


### **3. Travel:** 

- **Walking** was the most common form of travel, done alone or in groups along established routes like the Tōkaidō and Nakasendō roads. Travelers could stop at post towns and teahouses along the way. 

- **Ox carts and palanquins** offered transportation for the wealthy. Horses were reserved mainly for samurai.

- **Boats** connected coastal cities and allowed travel to offshore regions. Merchant ships facilitated trade while warships engaged in naval battles.

- **Rickshaws** emerged in Edo period cities as a form of transportation.

- **Pilgrimages** to sacred sites like Ise or Mount Fuji involved ritualized travel by foot.

- **Terrain** shaped travel experiences. Mountain trails and passes connected regions but posed challenges. Rivers aided inland travel but could flood. Dense forests offered seclusion or danger.  

Control of travel routes meant control of resources and strategic advantage. The nature of one's journey reflected social roles and obligations within the rigid class system.

### **2. Impact on Society and Culture:**

- **Economic impact**: Innovations in agricultural techniques, textile production, mining and forestry drove economic development. Cities flourished around guilds and became hubs for the exchange of ideas and specialized knowledge.

- **Social changes**: The samurai class gained prestige from mastering ever-more lethal weapons and armor. Skilled artisans like master swordsmiths also rose in status. Printmaking spread written works and information.

- **Knowledge and education**: Woodblock printing increased access to Buddhist texts, practical manuals, poetry, plays and history. Libraries were assembled by warlords and temples. Calligraphy and ink wash painting were revered arts.

- **Cultural identity**: Architecture, like the elegant refinement of the teahouse, shaped cultural aesthetics. Gardens expressed the ideal of balancing natural simplicity and controlled design. Bushido's codified principles reinforced the samurai identity.

- **Unintended consequences**: Shipbuilding and firearms originally introduced by Europeans were later used to strengthen isolationist policies and military power. Coal mining degraded environments.

### **3. Limitations and Drawbacks:**

- **Accessibility**: Only samurai and the wealthy could afford the most advanced armor, weapons, and castle architecture. Artisans kept techniques secret. Lower classes relied on traditional farming tools and wood buildings.

- **Ethical concerns**: Firearms and artillery were seen as dishonorable by some traditionalists. Persecution of Christians was justified on religious grounds. Censorship suppressed potentially subversive ideas.

- **Inari aids the blacksmith** - The blacksmith god Inari helps the peasant Okabe no Mitsuyori forge a legendary sword by possessing him during the process.

### **3. Impacts on Daily Life**

- **Religious practices**: The lives of people were intrinsically tied to rituals honoring the kami spirits and buddhas. At Shinto shrines like the Grand Shrine of Ise, priests performed daily offerings and prayers to kami like Amaterasu as devotees purified themselves through ritual washing. Local festivals saw parades of costumed villagers carrying mikoshi shrines through streets as part of raucous celebrations to please local kami. In Buddhism, temple visits were woven into yearly cycles for events like Obon when families communed with ancestral spirits and honored the impermanence of life.

- **Moral beliefs**: The myths full of drama between deities reinforced moral lessons. Amaterasu's retreat taught the virtue of perseverance in adversity. Susanoo's reckless destruction affirmed the need for self-control and concern for others. Tales of greedy tanuki foxes tricking humans warned against deception. These stories shaped interpersonal values on integrity, compassion, honesty and steadfastness. Parents instructed children through myth-inspired parables.

- **Art and literature**: Mythological themes were ubiquitous in cultural works, permeating everything from tempera painting and epic poetry to theater. Scenes of samurai hero Yoshitsune appeared in Noh and kabuki plays. Ukiyo-e woodblock prints depicted popular stories of shape-shifting fox spirits. Bunraku puppet shows brought tales of tengu goblins to life on stage. The Tale of Genji woven with allusions to characters like lady Rokujō demonstrated myth's role in prose.

- **Architecture**: Sacred sites prominently incorporated mythological symbolism. Shinto shrines framed entrances with chōzuya purification basins and torii gates to honor kami. Temples displayed fearsome statues of Niō warrior gods and carvings of dragons protecting Buddha. These visual expressions kept mythology ever-present. Homes oriented rooms and entrances based on auspicious myth-inspired directions believed to attract fortune.

### **4. Divine Figures and Mortals:**

- **Mortal heroes and chosen ones**: Heroes like the warrior Tawara Tōda who slays a monstrous centipede are empowered by divine swords or blessings. The hero Yamato Takeru honored by Amaterasu overcomes enemies with help from the gods. Monks like Kūkai and Kōbō Daishi were believed to attain enlightenment through mystic rituals granting divine insight.

- **Divine punishments**: Deities inflict harm upon mortals that anger or offend them. The sea kami drown fishermen who fail to make offerings. Amaterasu withdraws light when Susano misbehaves. Yomotsu-shikome, Izanami's avenging hag minions, punish mortal transgressions. 

- **Divine rewards**: The faithful are rewarded, like how Inari aids the devoted blacksmith Mitsuyori. Quests to appease deities through temple building and rituals are believed to gain their favor and blessings. Shrines funded by daimyo demonstrate prayers being answered with protection and prosperity.

### **5. Impact on the Afterlife and Ancestor Worship**

- **Concepts of the afterlife**: Shinto views the afterlife as a dark place of pollution and decay. Buddhism sees it as either a paradise for the virtuous or a realm of suffering to purge sins before rebirth. Traditions blended - graves became peaceful abodes between reincarnations. 

- **Ancestor worship**: Reverence for ancestors was paramount. Gravesites were sacred ground where offerings honored the dead. Obon festivals, sutra chanting, and gifts like ohaguro blackened teeth at funerals ensured they lived well in the afterlife.

- **Bonds between living and dead**: Belief that ancestral spirits returned yearly for Obon affirmed bonds transcending death. Testament to filial piety was thought to ensure favor in the afterlife. Disrespect risked becoming a vengeful ghost.

## Geographical Overview

Feudal Japan, spanning roughly from the 12th to the 19th century, was characterized by a complex socio-political structure and a landscape defined by diverse geographic regions. These regions played a significant role in shaping the culture, economy, and history of Japan during this era. Here's an overview of some of the key regions:

1. **Kanto Region**: Centered around modern-day Tokyo, the Kanto region was home to the political powerhouses of Kamakura and Edo (Tokyo). It was a strategic area due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, and it served as the seat of power for various shogunates. The Kanto Plain, a fertile lowland, facilitated agriculture and economic development.

2. **Kansai Region**: This region, encompassing cities like Kyoto and Osaka, was the cultural and historical heart of Japan. Kyoto was the imperial capital for much of feudal history and played a crucial role in shaping Japanese traditions, including art, religion, and literature. The Kansai area was characterized by hilly terrain, which influenced settlement patterns and urban development.

3. **Chubu Region**: Located between the Kanto and Kansai regions, Chubu was a vital trade corridor. Cities like Nagoya and Kanazawa flourished due to their connections with both regions. The Japanese Alps traverse this area, providing resources like timber and minerals.

4. **Chugoku Region**: This western region is known for its proximity to the Korean Peninsula. Important cities included Hiroshima and Okayama. The Seto Inland Sea played a role in maritime trade and communication between Honshu and Shikoku.

5. **Shikoku Region**: Shikoku is the smallest of the four main islands and is known for its mountainous terrain and rugged coastline. The region's isolation contributed to the development of unique cultural practices and traditions. The 88 Temple Pilgrimage is a famous religious route on the island.

6. **Kyushu Region**: Kyushu, the southernmost of the main islands, has a warmer climate and proximity to other parts of East Asia led to early interactions with neighboring cultures. The region was a center for trade and foreign relations, with cities like Fukuoka and Nagasaki gaining prominence.

7. **Tohoku Region**: The northern Tohoku region experiences colder climates and heavy snowfall. It was historically a less densely populated area, known for its natural beauty and resources. The city of Sendai was a notable political and economic hub in this region.

8. **Hokkaido**: While not as prominent during feudal times, Hokkaido in the far north was inhabited by the indigenous Ainu people. Japanese expansion into Hokkaido began more significantly in the later stages of the feudal era.

These regions were not only defined by their geographical features but also by the political entities that held power, such as the shogunates, daimyos (feudal lords), and the imperial court. Feudal Japan's landscape, with its diverse climate, topography, and resources, played a pivotal role in shaping the socio-economic structure, cultural practices, and historical developments of this era.
