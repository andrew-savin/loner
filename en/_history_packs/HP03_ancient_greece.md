## Special Rules

1. **Oracle's Favor**: Whenever a character seeks guidance from an Oracle or consults a prophecy, roll a six-sided die.

2. **Socratic Wisdom**: If a character engages in a philosophical debate or seeks knowledge through deep contemplation. This represents the character gaining partial insights but not a complete understanding, mirroring the nature of philosophical discourse.

3. **Olympian Blessing**: Before significant physical challenges or contests, a character can invoke the favor of an Olympian god. A "Yes" result indicates that the character receives a temporary boost or advantage, possibly due to divine intervention.

4. **Fateful Coin**: Characters can possess a special coin with one side depicting a laurel wreath (symbolizing victory) and the other a thunderbolt (symbolizing adversity). They can flip the coin before making a decision. If the side facing up matches the outcome they desire, the Oracle's answer shifts up one level (e.g., "No but" becomes "Yes but"). This represents an element of choice and chance.

5. **Athenian Democracy**: In situations involving diplomacy, politics, or consensus-building, a character can invoke the principles of Athenian democracy. If the character's approach aligns with democratic ideals, a result of "Yes," reflects the power of the people's voice.

6. **Spartan Resolve**: Characters who follow the strict Spartan code can roll twice for their closed question resolution. They choose the better outcome from the two rolls. This represents their resilience and discipline in the face of challenges.

# Part II Setting Information

## Culture and Society

### **1. Social Structure:**
The Ancient Greek setting is characterized by a distinct social hierarchy that plays a pivotal role in shaping the lives and interactions of its inhabitants. This era and location encompass a society deeply rooted in city-states, each with its own unique customs and practices.

- **Social Classes**: The society is divided into three primary social classes. At the top are the **Aristoi**, the noble elite who hold political power and influence. They own vast estates, command the military, and often lead the city-states. Below them are the **Hoi Polloi**, the commoners who make up the bulk of the population. They engage in various trades, crafts, and farming, contributing to the economy. Finally, there are the **Thetes**, who are the poorest citizens and may struggle to have a voice in the political affairs of the city-state.

- **Women's Role**: In this patriarchal society, women occupy a limited role in public life. Generally, they are expected to manage the household, raise children, and support their husbands. However, exceptions exist, such as priestesses and some wealthy women who have greater access to education and social influence. The Athenian women, for instance, are known for their involvement in religious ceremonies and certain cultural events.

- **Caste System or Hierarchies**: The Ancient Greek world doesn't possess a rigid caste system like some other cultures, but hierarchies based on birth, wealth, and citizenship are prominent. Slaves, known as **Doulos**, form a significant part of the society. They lack personal freedom and are often treated as property. The status of citizenship grants political rights and responsibilities, but these rights are often restricted to free-born adult males. Foreigners and metics (resident aliens) have varying degrees of legal protection and access to public affairs.

**2. Religion:**
Religion occupies a central and influential role in the Ancient Greek setting, shaping every aspect of life, from personal beliefs to political decisions. The Ancient Greeks hold a polytheistic belief system, attributing various aspects of life to a diverse pantheon of deities.

- **Pantheon of Deities**: The Greek pantheon is rich and intricate, with each deity governing different aspects of the natural and human world. Chief among them are **Zeus**, the king of the gods and the god of thunder; **Hera**, the queen of the gods and protector of marriage; **Athena**, the goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare; **Apollo**, the god of music, prophecy, and healing; and **Aphrodite**, the goddess of love and beauty. Each deity possesses unique attributes and myths that reflect their domains and influence over mortal affairs.

- **Religious Practices and Rites**: Religion is deeply embedded in daily life, with a range of practices and rituals honoring the gods. Temples serve as centers of worship, with priests and priestesses performing ceremonies, sacrifices, and divinations. Festivals, like the Olympics and the Panathenaea, bring communities together to honor specific deities. The Oracle of Delphi holds special significance, providing prophecies that guide important decisions.

- **Impact on Culture and Politics**: Religion permeates culture, art, and politics. Temples and statues of gods and heroes adorn cities, embodying cultural ideals. Religious festivals foster unity and provide moments of respite from conflict. The consultation of oracles influences strategic decisions and alliances. Religious beliefs guide morality and ethics, shaping the characters' motivations and actions. In the turbulent times of the setting, aligning oneself with a specific deity or seeking divine favor can greatly impact the outcome of conflicts.

The Ancient Greek religious beliefs not only reflect their worldview but also serve as a driving force behind cultural expression, political maneuvering, and personal convictions, all of which deeply influence the characters' journeys and choices.

- **Flora and Fauna**: Olive groves, vineyards, and fields of wheat and barley thrive in the temperate climate. Olive trees, in particular, are a symbol of peace and prosperity, dotting the landscape with their silver-green leaves. Wildlife includes deer, boars, and various bird species. Mythical creatures such as centaurs, sirens, and minotaurs are also woven into the fabric of this world, inspiring legends and cautionary tales.
