## Special Rules

These special rules add depth, flavor, and interactive elements to your closed question resolution system, weaving the themes and cultural aspects of Ancient Egypt into the mechanics of the game.

**1. Oracle's Favor:** Before rolling for an action, players can spend an "Oracle's Favor" token to ask a specific yes/no question to gain insight into the outcome. This token can be acquired through role-playing exceptional moments or achieving significant goals.

**2. Divine Intervention:** Players can invoke a deity's intervention by describing a brief prayer or offering before a crucial action. The GM then narrates a response that modifies the outcome, potentially shifting a "No" to a "Yes but" or "Yes and," or vice versa.

**3. Fate's Threads:** Players can choose to narrate their action in a way that weaves in a key element of their character's backstory, which may influence the Oracle's answer. This adds a role-playing dimension to decision-making and encourages character development.

**4. Offering Sacrifices:** Characters can offer valuable items or perform a special ritual to gain advantage on a roll. This advantage could potentially shift a "No" to a more positive outcome or grant a higher chance of success.

**5. Curse of the Pharaohs:** Introduce a "Curse" mechanic where certain actions carry a risk of invoking a curse. If the Oracle's answer is "Yes," the GM narrates an unexpected and potentially negative consequence that must be overcome in the future.

**6. Omen Tokens:** At the start of each session, players receive a limited number of Omen Tokens. They can spend these tokens to adjust the Oracle's response in their favor or even ask a follow-up question to clarify a "Yes but" or "No but" response.

**7. Alignment with Stars:** Each character has an alignment with one of the prominent constellations of Ancient Egypt. When invoking their alignment, players can shift a "No" to a "Yes but" or a "Yes" to a "Yes and" based on the corresponding celestial influence.

**8. Ancestral Guidance:** Characters can meditate or seek out a quiet place to connect with the wisdom of their ancestors. This grants them insight, allowing them to re-roll an action and choose the more favorable result.

**9. Time-Flows:** Characters can manipulate the flow of time by meditating at a sacred location or using a special artifact. This enables them to retry an action, potentially altering the Oracle's response.

**10. Riddles of the Sphinx:** Incorporate riddles or challenges inspired by the Sphinx, where players can gain hints or clues from solving these enigmas, which they can then use to influence the Oracle's response.
