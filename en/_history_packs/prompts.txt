***Loner*** is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations. 
Adventure Packs are very lightweight settings in which some elements are provided to kick start your game in some predefined genres.
Inside you will find a concise setting, traits for characters, special setting rules, NPCs, enemies, factions, locations and adventure seeds.
