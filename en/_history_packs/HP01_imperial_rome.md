## Special Rules

- **Favor of the Gods:** Before attempting a significant action, the player can invoke the favor of the gods by asking a specific closed question like, "Do the gods smile upon my endeavor?" If the resolution answer is "Yes and," the character gains a significant advantage in their action. If the answer is "No but" or worse, they suffer from an unforeseen setback or complication due to divine disfavor.
- **Political Influence:** Characters can use their connections and social standing to influence certain actions. By asking questions like, "Do I have a powerful ally in the Senate?" or "Can I leverage my family's name in this situation?" the player can gain an advantage or disadvantage depending on the resolution answer.
- **Gladiatorial Crowd Favor:** During gladiatorial combat, the player can ask questions related to the crowd's favor, like "Does the crowd cheer for me?" or "Do they demand a lethal strike?" The answers can impact the character's morale and the reaction of the crowd, potentially altering the flow of the battle.
- **Investigation and Clues:** When investigating mysteries or uncovering secrets, players can ask closed questions about finding critical clues. A "Yes and" could lead to the discovery of a crucial piece of evidence, while a "No but" might reveal a less helpful clue that requires additional effort to decipher.
- **Senatorial Support:** In political scenarios, the player can inquire about gaining the support of influential senators or factions. A positive outcome might grant them political advantages, while a negative one could lead to opposition or sabotage.
- **Slave Rebellion:** When attempting to incite a slave rebellion, players can use closed questions to gauge the response of fellow slaves. A "Yes and" might lead to an uprising, while a "No but" could indicate that some are hesitant or that a faction of slaves betrays the cause.
- **Epic Feats:** For grandiose actions, like defeating a powerful adversary or rallying troops for a crucial battle, players can ask for an epic resolution by using a closed question such as, "Is this moment destined to be remembered in history?" The answer might shape the outcome in extraordinary ways.
- **Cultural Customs:** Closed questions can be employed to explore the adherence or violation of cultural customs. For instance, "Is this action in accordance with Roman traditions?" could lead to various outcomes depending on the resolution answer.

In Imperial Rome, the social structure was deeply hierarchical, with clear distinctions between various classes, each playing specific roles in society. The setting takes place in the heart of the Roman Empire, where power, wealth, and social standing were defining factors in people's lives.

- **Social Classes:** 
    - **Patricians:** The aristocratic elite of Rome, comprising wealthy and influential families who held significant political power. They controlled vast estates, served in the Senate, and held key military and administrative positions.
    - **Plebeians:** The commoners, comprising the majority of the population. They included artisans, traders, laborers, and the urban poor. Although they had limited political rights compared to Patricians, they could participate in the popular assemblies and vote.
    - **Slaves:** Enslaved individuals who had no personal rights and were considered property. They performed various tasks, from menial labor to skilled work, and their social standing was at the bottom of the hierarchy.
- **Women's Role:**
    Women in Imperial Rome had limited rights compared to men. They were expected to be virtuous and fulfill traditional roles as wives, mothers, and guardians of the household. Most women were excluded from political life, but some elite women from noble families had more influence and access to education. Priestesses and Vestal Virgins held unique positions and enjoyed higher respect in religious matters.
- **Caste System or Hierarchies:**
    Rome did not have a formal caste system like other ancient civilizations, but there were still hierarchies within the social classes:
    - **Within Patricians:** There were prominent families with greater wealth and influence than others. These leading families often vied for power and prestige within their ranks.
    - **Within Plebeians:** The wealthier and more successful Plebeians could afford better education and access to certain privileges, while the urban poor struggled with poverty and limited opportunities.
    - **Slaves:** The social status of slaves depended on their roles and their owners. Some skilled slaves, such as tutors or artisans, might enjoy a relatively better standing, while others endured harsh treatment and labor.

These social distinctions deeply influenced social interactions, opportunities, and the distribution of rights within the Roman Empire. Patricians held significant sway over political decisions, while Plebeians fought for greater representation. Slaves faced a life of servitude and hardship, with little hope of improving their social standing. Women, while restricted, could still exert their influence within the confines of their roles, and some managed to leave their mark in history through unconventional means. The social structure and hierarchies shaped the dynamics of the era.

### **2. Religion:**

Religion played a central role in the lives of people during the historical period of Imperial Rome. The Roman pantheon of deities was diverse and deeply ingrained in the fabric of society, influencing various aspects of daily life.

    - Neptune: God of the sea, revered by sailors and those involved in maritime activities.
    - Minerva: Goddess of wisdom, arts, and crafts, often associated with intellectuals and artisans.
- **Religious Practices and Rites:**
    Roman religious practices involved various rituals, ceremonies, and festivals dedicated to the gods. Temples were erected in honor of deities, where priests conducted daily offerings and rites. Public ceremonies and sacrifices were held on special occasions, such as religious festivals and state events. The Vestal Virgins played a crucial role as guardians of the sacred flame of Vesta, the goddess of the hearth and home.
- **Impact on Culture and Politics:**
    Religion had a profound impact on Roman culture, politics, and social norms. Public observance of religious practices was seen as crucial to maintaining the favor of the gods and ensuring the prosperity of the state. Political decisions often had religious considerations, and leaders sought divine signs and prophecies before embarking on important ventures, such as military campaigns or building projects. Religious festivals and games were also means to appease the gods and solidify social cohesion.

    For characters in the setting, religious beliefs could guide their actions and moral principles. Some might seek the favor of specific deities, like soldiers praying to Mars for victory in battle or merchants seeking blessings from Mercury for prosperous trade.

    - **Veneration of the Spirits (Lares and Manes):** Beyond the afterlife in the Underworld, Romans believe in the existence of spirits known as Lares and Manes. Lares are household spirits that protect and oversee the welfare of the family, while Manes represent the ancestral spirits of deceased family members.
- **Ancestor Worship:**

These small, private spaces serve as focal points for daily offerings, prayers, and rituals to honor and seek protection from the ancestral spirits. The veneration of ancestors fosters a strong sense of familial continuity and unity.
    - **Ancestral Feasts and Festivals:** Romans hold special feasts and festivals to commemorate the spirits of their deceased ancestors. During these occasions, families gather to make offerings, share meals, and recount stories of their ancestors, fostering a profound connection with their lineage and heritage.
    - **Influence on Family Values:** Ancestor worship reinforces the importance of family bonds and filial piety. Respect and reverence for ancestors are considered essential virtues, guiding individuals in their conduct and responsibilities toward family elders and ancestors.

- **Integration with Religious Observances:**
    - **Public Ceremonies and Religious Rites:** Ancestor worship is deeply integrated into broader religious observances. During public ceremonies and festivals dedicated to the gods, Romans also remember their ancestors and seek their blessings and protection for the community.
    - **Imperial Cult and Deified Ancestors:** In Imperial Rome, emperors are often deified after death, becoming ancestors to the state. The imperial cult involves the veneration of deceased emperors, emphasizing the continuity of the Roman Empire's divine connection through the revered lineage of its rulers.
