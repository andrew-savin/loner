# Pulp Adventures

***Pulp Adventures*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a vibrant, action-packed world inspired by early 20th-century pulp fiction. Dive into thrilling escapades across exotic locales, facing larger-than-life heroes, formidable villains, and supernatural perils.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be fast-paced, immersive, and easy to pick up, providing endless hours of adventurous storytelling.

## Introduction

*Pulp Adventures* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: To play, you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: The game relies on a few rules and only one resolving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: Characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Pulp Adventures** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Daring Explorer," "Mysterious Artifact," and "Cunning Villain."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG, a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series), a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are predetermined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Pulp Adventures* you will need:
- **4 six-sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and a pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Pulp Adventures* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind." But you can keep track of your game if you feel the need!

## Setting Introduction

*Pulp Adventures* transports you to a world brimming with the thrill and mystery of classic pulp fiction. Imagine yourself exploring remote and unexplored regions like lost civilizations, uncharted islands, and hidden valleys. You’ll traverse exotic cities and metropolises such as Cairo, Shanghai, and New York City, uncovering secrets in ancient ruins and lost temples like Mayan pyramids and the legendary Atlantis.

In this world, larger-than-life heroes take center stage. These adventurous and daring protagonists range from fearless explorers and treasure hunters to cunning private eyes. They come from diverse backgrounds, each resourceful and strong-willed, with charismatic personalities that captivate and inspire.

The setting is rich with classic pulp archetypes. Two-fisted adventurers and treasure hunters embark on dangerous quests, while intrepid reporters and fearless journalists seek the truth. Daring pilots and dashing aviators soar through the skies, cunning private investigators and hard-boiled detectives unravel mysteries, and mysterious, alluring femme fatales weave their intricate webs.

Your adventures will be filled with high-stakes quests and globe-trotting exploits, fraught with deadly traps and treacherous environments. You’ll face dangerous criminals, secretive cults, and villainous organizations, engaging in perilous chases and daring escapes.

The supernatural and the occult add another layer of intrigue. Ancient curses and forbidden knowledge lurk in the shadows, and mystical artifacts and relics hold incredible power. You’ll encounter strange creatures and beings like mummies, vampires, and aliens, while secret societies and cults pursue sinister agendas.

Cutting-edge technology, at least for the time period, plays a crucial role. Advanced gadgets and inventions, such as ray guns and experimental aircraft, are at your disposal. Mad scientists create bizarre inventions, and futuristic vehicles and modes of transportation propel your adventures forward.

Antagonists in *Pulp Adventures* are as memorable as the heroes. Sinister criminal masterminds and megalomaniacs plot their schemes, corrupt officials and power-hungry tyrants abuse their power, deranged cultists and fanatical followers carry out dark rituals, and ruthless treasure hunters and rival adventurers compete for glory and riches.

Combat is gritty and action-packed, featuring high-octane fistfights and brawls, intense shootouts and gunfights, and daring stunts and death-defying feats. Each encounter is a thrilling test of your hero’s mettle.

Expect cliffhanger endings and serialized narratives that keep you on the edge of your seat. Episodic adventures with recurring characters and storylines create dramatic cliffhangers and unresolved plotlines, fostering ongoing mysteries and overarching conspiracies that unfold over time.

The aesthetics and tone of *Pulp Adventures* are distinctly retro and vintage. Bold colors and dynamic poses define the art style, while sensationalized language and dramatic narration capture the essence of pulp fiction. Throughout your journey, a sense of wonder, excitement, and high adventure permeates every scene, making each moment unforgettable.

## Characters

In *Pulp Adventures*, characters are vibrant and dynamic, reflecting the larger-than-life nature of pulp fiction heroes and villains.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Pulp Adventures*, Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Pulp Adventures* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Pulp Adventures* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Pulp Adventures* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Yes, and... | You get what you want, and something else.              | Cause 3 |
| Yes...      | You get what you want.                                  | Cause 2 |
| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the Inspiration Tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### Daring Adventures

These rules are designed to be resolved using the oracular system of the game, maintaining the simplicity and fluidity of gameplay. Here are some genre-specific rules to immerse you in the pulp fiction world:

#### Exotic Locales and Exploration

Explorers in *Pulp Adventures* often find themselves navigating treacherous and uncharted territories. Successfully traversing these regions is crucial for survival and progression in the adventure.

- **Survival Check**: When a character is navigating remote regions, they must test their expectations using the Oracle system. Advantage or disadvantage can be added based on the character's skills, equipment, and the specific environment.
  - **Yes**: The character finds a safe path through the terrain.
  - **No**: The character encounters a complication or obstacle.
  - **Yes, but...**: The character finds a safe path, but with a minor complication or cost.
  - **Yes, and...**: The character finds a safe path and discovers something beneficial.
  - **No, but...**: The character encounters an obstacle, but mitigates some of the negative effects.
  - **No, and...**: The character encounters a significant obstacle with additional repercussions.
- **Complications and Obstacles**: Failing a Survival Check can lead to various complications, such as running out of supplies, getting lost, or encountering dangerous wildlife. The specific nature of the complication can be determined by consulting the "Exploration Encounters" table, which adds an element of unpredictability and excitement to the journey.
- **Resource Management**: Track supplies (e.g., food, water, ammunition). Deplete one unit of supplies after each significant encounter or at the end of each day of travel. If supplies run out, apply a Frailty tag such as "Starving" or "Dehydrated."

**Exploration Encounters**
| D6 | Encounter |
| -- | --------- |
| 1  | Treacherous terrain requires an immediate Survival Check. |
| 2  | Encounter with a hostile tribe or dangerous wildlife. |
| 3  | Discover a hidden path leading to an ancient ruin. |
| 4  | Find a valuable resource (e.g., fresh water, medicinal plants). |
| 5  | Sudden weather change complicates travel (e.g., storm, sandstorm). |
| 6  | Encounter a rival explorer or treasure hunter. |
